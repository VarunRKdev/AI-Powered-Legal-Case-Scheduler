Case5,Dr Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602,"The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion.

Case6,GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55,"I accept that the making of a rolled up offer inclusive of costs and interest may detract from the weight to be given to its refusal in the exercise of the discretion. Finn J referred to authorities on the point in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 ; (2003) 201 ALR 55 at [34] . His Honour cited single judge decisions to the effect that such offers ought not to be a relevant consideration on the question of costs and would not be considered in the same way as a Calderbank letter. His Honour was invited to depart from that line of first instance authority. However he was not prepared to say it was clearly wrong. Notwithstanding that, in the circumstances of the case he had to decide, his Honour found that: The fact that the offer gave no indication at all of the breakdown ... between the claim, interest and costs blunts significantly the weight to be given the offer. 35 While respecting the general approach to rolled up offers reflected in the cases to which Finn J referred, such approaches cannot be calcified into rules of law which fetter a general discretion. They simply reflect a common sense proposition that generally speaking such an offer is not unreasonably refused. There may, however, be circumstances where a rolled up offer, refused by an applicant who is unsuccessful, may support a claim for indemnity costs.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.117,0.043,0.84,0.9629,6.29615

Case8,Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374,"On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be ""plainly unreasonable"" for the requirement that it be ""unreasonable"". Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word ""plainly"" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function. 37 At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon: 1. UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and, in particular, that he had breached his fiduciary duty. 2. UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach, a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting (and which would have indicated to a reasonable person) the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA. 38 It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray. True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray's employment with UWA. But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case. This is not a case, in my opinion, in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex's offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it. 39 There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA's path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex. The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX-Spheres technology. There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors, apart from Dr Gray, were on notice of a potential claim. To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company. In addition, UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA's delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action. 40 The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion. On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced. That is a factor, given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed, that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter-offer. The counter-offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA's offers. It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.06,0.039,0.901,0.9163,6.186050000000001

Case12,R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518,"quia timet proceedings, the court will have regard to the degree of probability of the apprehended injury, the degree of the seriousness of the injury, and the requirements of justice between the parties. In R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518 Isaacs J observed (at 539): ""The Court is not entitled to apply the obstacle of injunction to the contemplated action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government unless not only a clear case of illegality, proved to be calculated to result in a clear injury, is established, but also it is shown that by no other means can injury be averted or sufficiently compensated for."" Dr I C F Spry, in Equitable Remedies (2001, 6 th ed), comments (at 378) that quia timet injunctions are not granted unless the imminence of the act to be prohibited is sufficiently clearly established to justify the court's intervention. The fact that there is no breach presently occurring may make it more difficult, as a matter of evidence, to establish that there is a sufficient risk of a future injury to justify the immediate grant of an injunction. If, in all the circumstances, the likelihood that an injury will take place is not sufficiently high, quia timet relief will be refused. The applicant will be left either to avail him or herself of such other remedies as may be open, or else to renew his or her application should the likelihood of an injury subsequently increase sufficiently to render equitable intervention appropriate. There is some debate as to whether a greater degree of proof is required in a case involving interlocutory quia timet relief than in a case involving a different kind of injunction. The issue is discussed in Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane (at [21-395]), and need not be further canvassed here. It is sufficient to note that, in many cases, it may be more difficult to prove that an apprehended injury will occur than it is to prove that an existing injury will continue.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.072,0.141,0.787,-0.9733,-0.3375499999999998
Case13,National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 65 ; (1987) 163 CLR 668,"It was not suggested in this proceeding that, so far as a Commonwealth revenue debt is concerned, there is any express statutory provision which alters the usual position which prevails as between creditor and debtor when a cheque is given in payment of a debt. That usual position was expressed by Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in National Australia Bank v KDS Construction Services Pty Ltd [1987] HCA 65 ; (1987) 163 CLR 668 , at 676 to be as follows: Generally speaking, when a cheque is given in payment of a debt, it operates as a conditional payment. The payment is subject to a condition that the cheque be paid on presentation. If it is dishonoured the debt revives. Although it is sometimes said that the remedy for the primary debt is suspended, the suspension is no more than a consequence of the conditional nature of the payment: Tilley v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1960] HCA 86 ; (1960) 103 CLR 529 , at pp 532-533, 535-536, 537. The condition is a condition subsequent so that, if the cheque is met, it ranks as an actual payment from the time it was given. Subject to non-fulfilment of the condition subsequent, the payment is complete at the time when the cheque is accepted by the creditor: Thomson v Moyse (1961) AC 967 , at p 1004. 14 It was submitted for the Deputy Commissioner that, in the events which had transpired in this case, that usual position had been altered by the signification by the Deputy Commissioner that he would agree to the dismissal of the winding up application once the proceeds of the cheque had been cleared. It seems to me though that the evidence is more consistent with the Deputy Commissioner's adopting a position which was in accordance with the general position when a cheque is given in payment of a debt. It has been accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation. Subject to the fulfilment of that condition, payment of the then outstanding amount of the debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner was complete upon the acceptance by the Deputy Commissioner on 10 November 2008 of the cheque then proffered on behalf of Ganter. In this regard, the fact that the proffered cheque was a bank cheque may well have provided a degree of comfort to the Deputy Commissioner in deciding to accept it, but the position would have been the same in law so far as the relationship of debtor and creditor was concerned had the cheque concerned been one where the drawer was other than a bank.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.042,0.045,0.913,0.0942,3.3327
Case14,George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note),"Strictly speaking, a cheque, even a bank cheque, is not a form of legal tender. Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision, the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or, subject to the limits specified, Australian coins see s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and s 16 of the Currency Act 1965 respectively. However, in general trade and commerce, as Mason J observed in George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note) by reference to Canadian authority, a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account. In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter's endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only, as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation",Criminal Case,Rape,0.068,0.014,0.918,0.6369,5.17515
Case15,Australian Mid-Eastern Club Limited v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399,"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque.

A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.06,0.07,0.87,-0.0731,2.7541499999999997
Case16,Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830,"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque. A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J. 21 In my opinion, the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made. As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) was decided, the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory. By s 459A(1)(b) of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company. The application for the winding up of Ganter was made by the Deputy Commissioner upon the filing of the application in this Court on 20 August 2008. At that time, the Deputy Commissioner was, on any view, a creditor. Like Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [5]), I am not persuaded that there is any requirement flowing from the Corporations Act that the applicant must continue to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard. As his Honour there states (ibid), and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes, the passage from the judgement of Menzies J in Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) does not support the existence of any such requirement. 22 The true position is that the applicant's status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company's failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company. That was the conclusion reached by Zeeman J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd (1994) 116 FLR 314 at 318. As did Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [6]), I agree with that conclusion. As Zeeman J observed in the Guy Holdings Case (at 320), ""in the case of an application under s 459P where the debt the subject of the statutory demand has been paid after the filing of the application, the application ought to be dismissed unless there is established some positive reason that a winding up order ought to be made"". His Honour is there referring to the way in which, in those circumstances, the discretion vested in the Court on the hearing of a winding up application by s 467 of the Corporations Act would ordinarily be exercised. 24 In their submissions the solicitors for the company pointed to the observation made by Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [8]), ""With trading companies the existence of a winding up proceeding is a very serious inhibition and has very serious impacts"". I respectfully agree. That is one reason why it behoves a company which wishes to keep trading to pay its debts as they fall due or at least later to comply with the terms of a statutory demand. It is also a reason why, all other things being equal, a Court would be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to dismiss a winding up application if satisfied that the debt owed to the applicant creditor had been paid. Another consideration not to be ignored is the protection of the revenue. Yet another consideration is that Ganter, by its solicitors, initially agreed with the Deputy Commissioner's proposal that on 13 November 2008 the adjournment of the application for one week ought to be sought. A further consideration is the public interest in whether a company which is presumed to be insolvent ought to be permitted to continue to trade or whether it ought to be wound up. 25 Ganter's change of heart as to the course which ought to be taken on 13 November 2008 seems to have been multi-factorial in origin. Inferentially from the submissions made to me and to the District Registrar it was founded upon what I regard as the misapprehension that the payment of an applicant creditor's debt obliged the Court to dismiss a winding up application, as opposed to that being a factor going to discretion. Likewise, it seems to have been grounded on the belief that the acceptance of the bank cheque by the Deputy Commissioner extinguished the debt then and there, as opposed to so doing upon the fulfilment of the condition subsequent of the cheque's being cleared. Further, it seems to have been grounded upon the belief that, the cheque payment having been recorded as a credit on 11 November 2008 in its accounts, the Deputy Commissioner was obliged, as a ""model litigant"" to agree to the dismissal of the winding up application on 13 November 2008. 26 This, with respect, misapprehends the obligation that falls on those representing the interests of the Crown in civil litigation. One of those interests, and it is a vital interest, is the protection of the revenue. The Deputy Commissioner would certainly have failed in his duty to the Court as a model litigant had the acceptance of the cheque and the terms upon which it had been accepted not been drawn to the Court's attention on 13 November 2008. It was. Especially as matters then stood as to the clearing of the bank cheque and the Deputy Commissioner's knowledge as to the practice of the NAB in relation to the circumstances in which it would not meet a bank cheque and the time within which any such disposition on the part of the bank would usually be signified, it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Commissioner to resist the dismissal of the application that day. The position then to take was a matter for the value judgement of the Deputy Commissioner in the circumstances in the administration of the taxation laws. The entry in the accounts of the ATO had no more than a provisional quality about it.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.083,0.042,0.876,0.9933,6.43855

Case19,Motor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd [1967] HCA 9 ; (1967) 116 CLR 177,"Assuming that the Deputy Commissioner ought presently to be regarded as an applicant whose debt has been paid, it does not, with respect, seem to me to follow that the application must therefore necessarily be dismissed. In his judgment in Motor Terms Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd [1967] HCA 9 ; (1967) 116 CLR 177 , at 194-195, Menzies J, in what is strictly an obiter dictum , opined: In the course of argument upon this appeal, reference was made to the consequence of a petitioning creditor being paid off between the presentation of the petition and the making of an order. That circumstance would not, in my opinion, put an end to the petition nor would it affect the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the petition although, of course, in such circumstances proceedings might not be continued and, if they were, the court could, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to make a winding up order upon the petition of a person not then a creditor. In that same case, Barwick CJ (at 179) also seems to have been of the view that, under the then statutory regime for the winding up of a company, the date for the determination of whether a petitioner was a creditor was the date of presentation of the winding up petition. 21 In my opinion, the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made. As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) was decided, the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory.

The delegate said: In his circumstances, if he believes that his homosexuality, and his relationship, would not be acceptable to the community in which he is living, it is only reasonable to believe that he should be discreet about such matters. It is important to have regard to the issues before the High Court in Appellant S395/2002 : The [first] Tribunal accepted that the appellants were homosexual, and that homosexual men in Bangladesh are a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees , as amended by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees 1967. However, the Tribunal rejected most of the claims made by the appellants as to the persecution they had suffered in Bangladesh, including claims that they had experienced threats and violence over many years. It found that they had not in the past suffered serious harm by reason of their homosexuality, observing that they had ""clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now"". Further: The [Tribunal] rejected their claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh by reason of their homosexuality. The Tribunal rejected most of their individual claims, but accepted that it was not possible to live openly as a homosexual in Bangladesh. It found, however, that the applicants had ""clearly conducted themselves in a discreet manner and there is no reason to suppose that they would not continue to do so if they returned home now"". The applicants contended that the Tribunal had erred in law by imposing upon them a requirement that they live discreetly in order to avoid persecution. All the members of the High Court held that the (first) Tribunal: ... had not imposed a requirement that the applicants live discreetly if they returned to Bangladesh. It had made a finding of fact that they would live discreetly. That finding did not itself involve error.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.099,0.847,-0.9866,-0.40810000000000013

The orders are made in circumstances where 'an investigation is being carried out', 'a prosecution has been begun' or 'a civil proceeding has been begun'. That is to say the orders can be made before liability is established and indeed before the evidence necessary to establish liability has been collected.

Case38,ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694,"It is not a necessary consequence of an order appointing a receiver that the receiver should deal with or liquidate the assets in question. The interlocutory and protective character of orders made under s 1323 must be borne in mind when defining the powers of the receiver. The appointment of a receiver has rightly been described as 'an extraordinary step' ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694 at [8] (Austin J). However depending upon the nature of the powers conferred on the receiver it may be less drastic than a freezing order which can only be varied by order of the Court. The interlocutory history of this case has already demonstrated that circumstances not contemplated when the original interim freezing orders were made have required their variation from time to time. I accept, with respect, the observation made by Austin J in Burke at [8]: 'Without wishing to lay down any general rules, it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified, even though Mareva Orders are in place, in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments, and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims, and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business. Where these circumstances exist in combination, and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved, the Court may conclude ...that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected, and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors.' The decision was cited with approval by Santow J in ASIC v Adler (supra) at 268-269. 30 Section 1323 does not make any express provision for the nature of the evidence on which the Court may act in making orders under it. Applications made under the section have an interlocutory character albeit there are no other specific proceedings to which they may relate. The section does not require concluded findings of fact about liability or whether assets have been dissipated. For the reasons already canvassed the Court, in making orders under s 1323 , engages in a risk assessment and management process. The logic of the section assumes that the Court will not always have before it evidence of the kind that would be necessary and admissible in proceedings to establish definitively the nature and extent of the assets of the persons under investigation and their liability to aggrieved persons. Nor will it necessarily have before it evidence of the kind that would establish definitively that dissipation of assets has occurred or is likely to occur or that flight is imminent. 31 The logic of s 1323 requires the Court to be able to act on evidence which might not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings leading to a definitive determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. Hearsay evidence may therefore be received and acted upon, not as proof of the truth of its content but as evidence of the existence of a risk or possibility that gives rise to the necessity for or desirability of a protective order. It is not necessary, in this context, to consider whether the proceedings are interlocutory for the purposes of the exception to the hearsay rule under s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) albeit that that exception is no doubt informed by similar considerations. Evidence may be received of the opinion of a suitably qualified person who has had the opportunity to review extensive documentation collected in the course of an investigation and to offer an overview of it for the benefit of the Court. In such a case the opinion or overview should be supported by reference to the relevant documentation and factual material. The opinion is received not for the determination of any ultimate issue of liability but as probative of the risk which the Court must assess in determining whether to make an order under the section. These considerations are relevant to the admissibility of some of the affidavit evidence which has been relied upon in this case. 32 Specific objection has been taken on behalf of the second defendant to the use of transcripts of examinations conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. It was submitted that pursuant to s 68(3) of the ASIC Act such transcripts are not admissible in evidence against the person who has signed the record in a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. It was submitted that the present proceedings are, in truth, proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. This is on the basis that if interlocutory in nature, then they are interlocutory in respect of proceedings not yet commenced but which will inevitably be penalty proceedings. 33 Accepting that there is a possibility that penalty proceedings may be taken against one or more of the defendants in this case that does not, in my opinion, render the present application an application for the imposition of a penalty or an application incidental to such proceeding. As already noted, evidence may be relied upon of a hearsay or opinion character in these proceedings which might not be admissible in penalty proceedings. The same is true for s 19 transcripts. 34 It was submitted for the second defendant that because ASIC seeks an order that the reasonable costs of the receivers and managers whose appointment it seeks should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants, that fact itself gives the present application the character of a penalty proceeding. In my opinion however, the submission is misconceived. An order for the payment of costs out of the collective assets of the defendants would not of itself amount to the imposition of a penalty. Although it may effectively deprive defendants of some of their property that imposition is not by way of punishment for any contravention of the law. 35 Objection was also taken to the admissibility against the second defendant of transcripts of examinations of other parties conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. In this respect s 77 of the ASIC Act was relied upon. That section provides: 'Where direct evidence by a person (the absent witness ) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding, a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter: (a) if it appears to the court or tribunal that: (i) the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or (ii) the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or (iii) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or (b) if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.' It was submitted for the second defendant that ASIC has not adduced evidence in respect of the matters set out in s 77(a) and that therefore the s 19 transcripts of those parties that are not parties to the proceeding may only be tendered if the conditions set out in par (a) are set out. Counsel for ASIC on the other hand submitted that the second defendant had not required ASIC to call any absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and that therefore the condition of admissibility under s 77(b) of the Act was satisfied. Given the urgency with which the application has been made, it is perhaps a little unrealistic to require advance notice by the second defendant of the requirement that any absent witness whose s 19 transcript is relied upon be called as a witness in the proceeding. In my opinion, however, the transcripts of the examinations conducted under s 19 can be relied upon as tending to establish the possibility that circumstances exist which give rise to the necessity or desirability of a protective order. What is in evidence here is the fact that the statement was made in the course of a s 19 examination. The fact that the statement was made, rather like the hearsay evidence referred to earlier, may support an inference that circumstances exist that make a protective order necessary or desirable. It is not necessary to rely upon such evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement made.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.084,0.05,0.867,0.9908,6.4368
Case39,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561,"In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 ("" Pegasus ""), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]: ""The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme."" 35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.082,0.003,0.915,0.9943,6.40105

Case49,OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500,"Section 1324 permits the Court to grant an injunction ""on such terms as the court thinks appropriate"". These words echo the concluding words of s 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (""TPA"") which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. These words were introduced into s 80(1) by a 1983 amendment to the TPA, which, to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500 at 508, freed the power conferred by s 80 from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed. 67 French J said that s 80 was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V. His Honour added at 268: ""There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court. The possibility remains open, by virtue of s 80(3) , that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order. The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act .

But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights. Public interest injunctions are different. Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy. Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees, have decided are contrary to the public interest (contracts, arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely (s 45)), the misuse of market power (s 46) , the practice of exclusive dealing (s 47) , resale price maintenance (s 48) , price discrimination (s 49) , anti-competitive mergers (s 50) and unfair practices with respect to consumers (Pt V).

Thus, the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J. 71 The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s 80 of the TPA. As the Full Court explained, this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court's power under s 80 and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction: ""In our view, the need, suggested by the authorities, for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J's insistence that the power be exercised 'judicially and sensibly'. It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s 80(1) , not to the extent of the power to grant it. If the Court considers that a complete prohibition, whether permanently or for a specified period, on a respondent's engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention, s 80 is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power. This analysis of s 80 conforms, we consider, with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 at 504 [110]."" The Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus, as the evidence and the trial judge's findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would, unless restrained, commit further conduct of the same general kind. In these circumstances, it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention: at [34] and [38]. 72 In the present case, I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate, especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form. The evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act . There is, in my opinion, a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par 5 of the draft orders, and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case. The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants. In all the circumstances, I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted, and that it will serve the public interest. 73 ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(1) of the Act . A number of ancillary orders are sought, including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. The defendants consent to these orders being made. I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme. The first alteration, in par 7, identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on 25 October 2005. The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par 9 are the individuals identified in the above par 7 of the orders.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.076,0.016,0.908,0.9936,6.4176

The operation of s 31A was considered by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720. I do not think it necessary to enter into the interesting questions of what the particular standard imposed by the new version of s 31A might be. This is because whatever the bar is, the current applications pass well beneath it. That is, I find that they are, despite their creativity, devoid of merit. It follows, in my opinion, that there should be orders under s 31A. That makes it unnecessary for me to consider the operation of Order 20 rule 5 or to consider the operation of Order 11 rule 16 in so far as the statement of claim is concerned. 40 Mr Gargan argued that s 31A was constitutionally invalid. Normally s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) would impose upon this Court an obligation not to proceed to deal with Mr Gargan's constitutional argument without adjourning the proceeding in order to allow the various Attorneys-General for the States and of the Commonwealth a chance to intervene. However, s 78B operates on constitutional matters. I do not think that a constitutional argument which is completely devoid of merit amounts to a constitutional matter within the meaning of those provisions. To make good that point, it is necessary to take account of what the argument is. 41 The argument is that s 31A operates to ""dictate"" to the Federal Court what the outcome of the case is. There may well have been an issue if s 31A had commanded the Court to dismiss a proceeding which had any of the qualities described in s 31A(1)(a) or (b). However, the plain text of s 31A is that the Court ""may"" give judgment. There is simply no room to argue whatever that s 31A operates as a dictation. Accordingly I reject that argument.

Case59,Daemar v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45,"Mr Gargan also argued that he had an entitlement to the issue of orders in the nature of mandamus against the Official Trustee. There may be a question in my mind as to whether that kind of right is a right which would vest, or would be property which is capable of vesting, in the Official Trustee. There are decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which indicate that the right to seek mandamus may be a right which vests in the trustee: cf. Daemer v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45 at 54. However, for present purposes, it is not necessary to explore that proposition. On any view, the duties which are capable of being litigated in a mandamus application are duties of a public kind. I do not think that even if the difficulties in s 86 could be overcome by Mr Gargan that the duty thereby created could be described as public duty. Accordingly, I do not think that a case for issue of orders in the nature of mandamus has any prospects of success. 38 It is then necessary to say a little bit about the nature of the applications which are currently before the court. The first is an application pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) . Section 31A of that Act provides: Summary judgment (1) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. (4) This section does not limit any powers that the Court has apart from this section.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.128,0.051,0.821,0.9864,6.375400000000001

Case64,Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24 ; (1996) 189 CLR 51,"Fourthly, Mr Gargan relied upon the proposition that the Australian Capital Territory Local Court was a State court and that through various procedural alterations to the jurisdictions of State courts over the last 20 years, they had become unfit receptacles for federal jurisdiction within the meaning of the High Court's decision in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24 ; (1996) 189 CLR 51 . This argument is without merit. The Local Court of the Australian Capital Territory is not a State court for the purposes of the doctrine in Kable . Even if it were, Mr Gargan did not point to any provisions of the kind at suit in Kable itself which might give rise to the suggested incompatibility. 24 Fifthly, Mr Gargan placed some reliance upon the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 (NSW) which, outside consent matters, gave a right to trial by jury. The short answer is that that Act has been replaced by the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). In any event, any application that Act may have had to Local Court proceedings in Canberra or to Federal Court proceedings before Hely J, remains even now, elusive. 25 Finally Mr Gargan relied upon the notion that he was pursuing a civil penalty within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). I do not think that argument has any substance.

Case65,Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172,"As to the annulment of the 1994 bankruptcy, this Court has vested in it, by s 27 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy. The meaning of that expression has recently been considered by a Full Court of this Court in the decision of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the precise boundaries of the nature of jurisdiction in bankruptcy. It suffices to observe that an application to annul a bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B lies squarely within the heartland of that jurisdiction. 9 Section 153B provides: Annulment by Court (1) If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor's petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy. (2) In the case of a debtor's petition, the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented. 10 It is apparent from a cursory reading of s 153B that there are two elements to it. The first is the satisfaction in the Court of the fact that a sequestration order ought not to have been made. The second is an exercise by the court of a discretionary power if that condition precedent is satisfied.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.065,0.011,0.924,0.8962,6.0827
Case66,"Re Gargan; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (unreported, FCA, Kiefel J, 23 August 1996)","As I understood his submissions, the central proposition was that whilst he accepted he had consented to the making of the sequestration order in 1994, he had done so in circumstances where he was na&iuml;ve about the operation of the legal system. His admission that the sequestration order had been by consent is recorded in the reasons of Kiefel J in Re Gargan; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 685 (unreported, Kiefel J, 23 August 1996). Those proceedings involved an earlier attempt by Mr Gargan to annul the bankruptcy. 14 Her Honour recited an affidavit (at [21]) which had been filed by Mr Gargan and which recorded the fact that he no longer opposed the making of the sequestration order. I did not understand Mr Gargan to cavil with that in the course of argument but instead, as it were, he sought to admit and avoid. 15 Notwithstanding his, at times, ingenious submissions, I am not persuaded that the circumstances surrounding the making of the sequestration order in 1994 are such that I could now be satisfied that it ought not to have been made. It seems, therefore, that the power under s 153B to annul the 1994 bankruptcy does not arise. 16 Although it is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the likely disposition of the exercise of the discretionary power thereby conferred if it had arisen, I should say for completeness, even if the power in s 153B had been enlivened, I would not have exercised the discretion in Mr Gargan's favour. This is because first, it is apparent and indeed accepted, that the sequestration order was not ultimately resisted. Whatever else one might say about that, it provides a powerful discretionary reason, 14 years later, not now to undo it. 17 Secondly and, perhaps, related to the first point, is the fact that there has now been an extensive delay of 14 years. Finally, there is, of course, the fact that a prior application has been made to annul this bankruptcy and has failed. In each of those circumstances, it seems to me that even construing the amended application and statement of claim in the most charitable of fashions, it simply could not be the case that a claim, now to be brought by Mr Gargan to annul the first bankruptcy, would have any prospects whatsoever. 42 The first and second respondents apply for indemnity costs orders in relation to the dismissal which I have just ordered. It seems to me that in the exercise of the costs discretion the following matters are pertinent. First, the current proceeding involves attempts to re-litigate a number of matters which Mr Gargan has extensively litigated in the past and unsuccessfully. Secondly, in relation to the annulment application, he has made at least one prior annulment application before Kiefel J and failed. Thirdly, he has sought to articulate an argument based upon s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), which operation has been determined, to his knowledge, in a contrary way by the Full Court in Heinrich . 43 Finally, I take into account as a matter of overall impression, that this proceeding commenced by Mr Gargan, in common with a number of other proceedings commenced by him, involve what appear on their face sometimes to be engaging, if obscure, legal questions. However, those arguments are rarely thought through to their final conclusion, and despite Mr Gargan's protestation of having studied law for two years, seem to indicate a desire more to be involved in the disposition of clever legal arguments in court rather than any focused attention upon what the consequences of his actions might be in relation to the parties against whom he brings his proceedings. 44 I am particularly mindful of the fact that Mr Gargan is an undischarged bankrupt. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) are, by and large, directed to preventing the bringing of proceedings of the current kind. Although Mr Gargan articulated various ways in which it might plausibly be thought in some obscure circumstances that the current applications might be brought, I have found that those attempts were wholly unsuccessful and meritless. It seems to me that it is appropriate to mark disapprobation of the bringing of these proceedings by the making of the costs orders sought.

I readily accept that the Act has given express and considerable prominence to the role of the local Aboriginal communities, and that the Act envisages that consultation with such communities be undertaken in defined circumstances. However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal.

In that case, at 558, Wilcox J drew the following distinction in relation to the power in question: I see a conceptual distinction between a power to issue an instrument, which itself has an operative legal effect, and a power to make a statutory decision which is immediately operative but, in the interests of good administration, is thereafter recorded in writing. 28 However, even if I am wrong about this matter and the focus of s 21R is upon the document being the operative act of appointment, in my view, s 33(3) does not operate to constrain the type of power referred to in s 33(4) of the Acts Interpretation Act . In Laurence 139 FCR at 558, Wilcox J briefly discussed the distinction between the type of power referred to in s 33(3) and the type of power referred to in s 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act . He concluded that the two subsections referred to different types of power, and therefore operated exclusively of each other. This distinction is similarly applicable as between s 33(3) and 33 (4), the former relating to the general making, granting or issuing of an instrument, the latter relating to the making of an appointment. 29 Section 33(3) is an enabling provision, which may or may not need to be relied upon in any given circumstance. However, the other enabling provision is s 33(4). I cannot see any reason to conclude that s 33(3) operates to constrain the effect of s 33(4) in interpreting s 21R.

Whilst I am concerned with the interpretation of a Commonwealth Act, it must be recalled that I am concerned primarily with Pt IIA which deals with Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage. The Act envisages that the Commonwealth Minister may delegate his powers to a state minister, which has occurred in this case. In my view, the Act envisages that a delegation could be made to the respondent in respect of the power to appoint inspectors in relation to Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage, and envisages that the state minister be given the discretion to exercise the power in view of the specific needs in Victoria of Aboriginal cultural heritage. The question here is whether the Act imposes a limitation on the respondent so as to prevent him from adding the new criteria in considering the appointment suspension or removal of inspectors. If the new criteria are inconsistent with the scheme in respect of inspectors and s 21R, then putting aside any proposed legislation, taking into account the new criteria would necessarily be taking into account an irrelevant consideration. 35 The Act does not contain any express limitation on the exercise of the respondent's power to suspend and remove. As I have said, I accept that the Act gives prominence to the role of Aboriginal people in deciding what should occur in respect of areas and objects of importance to them. In appointing inspectors under s 21R, the respondent has an obligation to consult a local Aboriginal community, in an endeavour to appoint people with the appropriate expertise and knowledge, and to ascertain whether the person is able to perform the duties of an inspector. These criteria must be taken into account, but are not necessarily the only criteria to be applied. I do not regard these criteria as the exhaustive criteria to which the respondent may have regard. 36 Further, there is nothing which would defeat the purposes of the Act if no inspectors were appointed, or all inspectors were temporarily suspended, or even if they were all removed. Section 4 of the Act sets out its purposes, which purposes can obviously be fulfilled without the appointment of inspectors. The Act applies to areas and objects in Australia, not just to Victoria. Part IIA and the appointment of inspectors under the Act only applies to Victoria. Whilst the appointment of inspectors may further the purposes of the Act, they are not necessary for the implementation of such purposes generally. 37 The principal power given to an inspector is that conferred by s 21C; that is to make an emergency declaration. The Commonwealth Minister, the respondent, and any other delegates of the Commonwealth Minister or of the respondent may also exercise the power to make an emergency declaration, as may a magistrate (although only on application by a local Aboriginal community).",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.033,0.045,0.922,-0.7183,0.4979499999999999

Case80,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"I should indicate that even if I came to the conclusion that there was a failure to adhere to a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, I would not consider that such failure would vitiate the decision to remove or suspend. I readily accept that the Act has given express and considerable prominence to the role of the local Aboriginal communities, and that the Act envisages that consultation with such communities be undertaken in defined circumstances. However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal. If necessary to decide, I would take the view that if there was a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, breach of that requirement would not lead to the invalidity of such a suspension or removal: see generally Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-391; and Bond v WorkCover Corporation (SA) (2005) 93 SASR 315 at 331-336.",Criminal Case,Theft,0.038,0.042,0.92,-0.2325,2.1902500000000003
Case81,R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd [1965] HCA 27 ; (1965) 113 CLR 177,"There are many instances where important and significant decisions need to be made, and full-time public servants or servants of the Crown are regarded as capable of exercising independent judgements in making such decisions. Without statutory permission, it is not to be assumed that a public servant or servant of the Crown in whom a statutory power has been reposed will follow orders given by a superior. In fact, if a public servant or servant of the Crown did not exercise for himself or herself a discretion given to him or her to exercise, then the decision made would be invalid: see, for e.g. R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd [1965] HCA 27 ; (1965) 113 CLR 177 at 201-202. There is nothing in the nature of the powers to be exercised, the context of their exercise, or the character of the office of inspector which leads to the conclusion that the new criteria could not be applied to the appointment of an inspector. In this case I do not see that the appointment of a public servant, who otherwise satisfies the criteria in s 21R, is an appointment that would be contrary to the scheme of the Act as a whole, or Pt IIA dealing with Victorian Aboriginal cultural heritage. 41 I observe that, to the extent it is relevant, at least nine of the inspectors must have been public servants who satisfied the new criteria before the suspension decision, having been appointed under the Act and having been presumably regarded as being able to fulfil the function of inspector. I make this observation in view of the fact that the suspension of nine inspectors was lifted because they already satisfied the new criteria to be applied by the respondent. 42 Therefore, in my view, putting aside any question of change of legislation, the new criteria could be applied under the Act in the appointment, suspension and removal of inspectors by the respondent.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.054,0.0,0.946,0.9442,6.2507

Case106,Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223,"The applicant contends that the Act does not apply to her and therefore the divestiture order is invalid because s 4(6)(a) is not a valid law of the Federal Parliament. In the alternative the applicant contends that if it is a valid law, nevertheless, the power in s 21A(4) was not engaged in this case because the requirements of s 25(1D) were not met and therefore the divestiture order is invalid. The applicant further contends that even if these two contentions fail, the divestiture order made by the respondent is invalid because, before it was made, the applicant was not accorded procedural fairness. In the further alternative, the applicant contends that the order is invalid because the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest within s 21A(4). In her application and statement of claim the applicant also contended that the divestiture order is invalid because the respondent applied a policy and did not genuinely consider the merits of the matter before him or because his decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223). At the hearing of the application, those two submissions were abandoned. 25 In relation to the applicant's first contention, the contention may be dealt with by reference to the facts stated to this point. In relation to the applicant's other contentions, I will need to set out the facts in more detail when considering the contentions. 26 Notices under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), were given but none of the Attorneys-General sought to intervene.

Case107,Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399,"In those circumstances, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the respondent's alternative submission that in 2004 there was an acquisition within s 21A(4) when the applicant's former husband transferred his interest in the property to the applicant, who then became the sole registered proprietor of the property. The submissions on this issue went no further than the question of whether or not there had been an 'acquisition' within s 21A(4) in 2004. The applicant submits that by reference to general concepts of real property law there was no acquisition in 2004 because the applicant, who was a joint tenant of the property, was already (ie, prior to becoming the sole registered proprietor) seised of the whole of the estate or interest: Bradbrook MacCallum and Moore, Australian Real Property Law (3 rd ed, 2002) 340 [10.02]. It has been said that a joint tenant cannot assign his or her interest but, rather, one of two joint tenants may enter into a transaction by way of release of the estate: Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399. In response to this submission of the applicant, the respondent referred to s 12A of the Act . That section relevantly provides: '(3) For the purposes of this Act , a person acquires an interest in Australian urban land even if: (a) the person acquires the interest jointly with another person or persons; (b) the person has previously acquired an interest in Australian urban land; or (c) the interest is an increase in the amount of an existing interest of the person in Australian urban land.' 74 I think there was an increase in the applicant's interest within the terms of s 12A(3)(c) when she became the sole registered proprietor of the property and therefore an 'acquisition' within the Act . 75 However, there are a number of further matters which arise once this conclusion is reached and these further matters were not the subject of detailed submissions. They are as follows: 1. The respondent was aware of the proposed acquisition in 2004 and, in fact, agreed to it taking place, although he did so on the applicant agreeing to sell the property and without the formal approval procedures prescribed by the Act being followed. 2. A question may arise as to whether the power to make an order requiring the applicant to dispose of the whole of the property is engaged, having regard to the particular interest acquired by the applicant in 2004. 3. The minute containing the recommendations adopted by the respondent makes it clear that it was the acquisition in 1995 which formed the basis of the order made by the respondent under s 21A(4). A question may arise as to whether, in those circumstances, the respondent's decision can only be considered by reference to that acquisition.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.112,0.013,0.876,0.9937,6.38195

Case109,Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576,"In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : ""To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair."" Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591. 100 The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592): 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.' 102 The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted): 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the ""pitch"" or ""balance"" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial ""lack of balance"". Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: ""Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.""' 103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.087,0.07,0.843,0.9804,6.4144000000000005
Case110,Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509,"I am not prepared to infer that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. In the notice of the order dated 23 February 2005 ([7] above) the respondent states that he is satisfied that the acquisition 'is contrary to the national interest'. The minute refers to the provisions of s 21A(4) and to that part of the subsection which refers to the national interest. It is clear that it was a matter which was brought to the respondent's attention. It is true that in terms of the minute the particular matters relevant to the national interest are not clearly identified. Furthermore, the respondent did not give reasons for his decision and he did not give evidence. However, care needs to be exercised in this area because of the broad nature of the concept of the national interest.

If, in its operation, a law affects a class of persons with respect to whom there is a power to make laws, the law may have the character of a law with respect to persons of that class. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient that the law should change, regulate or abolish the rights, duties, powers and privileges of the relevant class treated merely as members of the general public or of a substantially wider class than the class of persons who constitute the subject matter of the power. For example, a law which requires notification of symptoms of a disease after entry to Australia by aliens and citizens indifferently is not a law with respect to aliens though it may be a law with respect to quarantine. But if and to the extent that the law discriminates between the public at large and the relevant class of persons (whether textually or in its operation), there is an indicium that the law is a law with respect to persons of that class. That indicium may suffice to give the law the character of a law with respect to persons of that class and, if the discrimination is in a matter peculiarly significant to that class, the law will bear that character. In this respect, the aliens power is similar to the corporations power considered in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd . In that case, s 45D(1)(b)(i) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which protected the businesses of trading corporations was held to be supported by s 51(xx) of the Constitution as a law with respect to trading corporations.' 51 A narrower view of the aliens power has been taken on occasion (see Gaudron J in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 57) but I am satisfied that the views expressed by Brennan J in Cunliffe v Commonwealth (supra) are the principles binding on me.

Case114,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616): 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that ""the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case "" . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.' 99 In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs .

Case117,Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9 ; (1993) 179 CLR 155,"Certain laws have been held to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. Examples include laws which impose a fine or penalty or laws effecting or authorising seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. The test for determining if a law falls outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) has been variously stated. In Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9 ; (1994) 179 CLR 155 Brennan J said (at 179-180): 'Although s 51(xxxi) abstracts from other heads of power the power of acquisition which that paragraph itself confers, it does not thereby abstract the power to prescribe the means appropriate and adapted to the achievement of an objective falling within another head of power where the acquisition of property without just terms is a necessary or characteristic feature of the means prescribed. In each of the cases in which laws for the acquisition of property without the provision of just terms have been held valid, such an acquisition has been a necessary or characteristic feature of the means selected to achieve an objective within power, the means selected being appropriate and adapted to that end. Therefore a law which selects and enacts means of achieving a legitimate objective is not necessarily invalid because the means involve an acquisition of property without just terms. What is critical to validity is whether the means selected, involving an acquisition of property without just terms, are appropriate and adapted to the achievement of the objective. The absence of just terms is relevant to that question, but not conclusive. Where the absence of just terms enhances the appropriateness of the means selected to the achievement of the legitimate objective, the law which prescribes those means is likely to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. If it were otherwise, the guarantee of just terms would impair by implication the Parliament's capacity to enact laws effective to fulfil the purposes for which its several legislative powers are conferred. It would be erroneous so to construe grants of legislative power as to fetter their exercise by implying that s 51(xxxi) precluded the enactment of laws under other heads of power where the laws involved an acquisition of property without just terms, even though laws of that kind are appropriate and adapted to the execution of those powers in the public interest.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.067,0.035,0.898,0.9432,6.2692

Case119,"Patterson, Re; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291","The applicant submits that the question whether the Treasurer is satisfied that an acquisition is contrary to the national interest is a jurisdictional fact and that it is not made out if the matters the Treasurer took into account do not support a reasonable and rational conclusion to that effect. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Kirby J in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291, in particular at 504-505 [338]. The reasons of Kirby J do seem to support the submission advanced by the applicant, but I would not apply them in this case. None of the other Justices in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (supra) took a similar approach. For example, Gaudron J, who did discuss the concept of national interest, decided the case on the basis that the Minister asked herself the wrong question (at 417-420 [74]-[82]). If there is a jurisdictional fact in this case it is not whether the acquisition is contrary to the national interest but, rather, whether the Treasurer was satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. A question of that nature would not turn, ordinarily at least, on the Court's conclusion as to whether the material before the Minister provided a reasonable or rational foundation for the conclusion reached by the Minister. 122 I reject the applicant's submission that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. 123 For these reasons I make the following orders: 1. An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order made by the respondent on 23 February 2005 under s 21A(4) of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act') and relating to the land known as 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia, being the said land comprised in File Plan 42, Allotment 6, Hundred: Yatala; Subdivision: Grange ('the property'). 2. An order in the nature of mandamus, requiring the respondent to exercise his discretion pursuant to s 21A(4) of the Act and relating to the property according to law.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.089,0.033,0.877,0.9435,6.24325
Case120,Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87,"I was referred to the authorities which have considered the circumstances in which a legislative provision which is partially invalid will be read down: Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87 per Latham CJ at 108-111; Victoria v The Commonwealth (supra) per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 501-503. But for s 5A there might have been some difficulties in the way of reading down s 4(6)(a) so that it applied only to non-citizens not ordinarily resident in Australia. For example, there would be the difficulty of a law expressed in general terms and arguably no clear guide as to Parliament's intention as to an appropriate limitation. However, I do not think that those types of difficulties arise here, because by providing in s 5A what is in effect a statutory statement or definition of non-citizens who do and do not fall within the definition of natural persons caught by s 4(6)(a) the Federal Parliament has sufficiently revealed an intention that that subsection should operate in relation to non-citizens even if it is otherwise invalid. Section 4(6)(a) insofar as it applies to non-citizens is a valid exercise of the aliens power. 56 The applicant made reference to the Federal Parliament's power to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws (s 51(xxxi)). Initially, the applicant contended that ss 4(6) and 21A of the Act could not be justified by reference to this head of power because, first, the acquisition was not for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament had power to make laws, and secondly, the acquisition of property was not on just terms. At the hearing, counsel for the applicant said that he was prepared to concede for the purposes of the argument that if there was an acquisition of property it was on just terms. The respondent contends first that ss 4(6) and 21A stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) and, secondly, that in any event, there was no acquisition of property within the terms of s 51(xxxi). In my opinion, both of the respondent's submissions should be accepted.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.055,0.063,0.882,-0.2838,2.0146999999999995
Case121,Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501,"The scope of the external affairs power has been considered by the High Court in a number of recent decisions. Both parties referred extensively to the decisions in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501 (' Polyukhovich ') and Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416 (' Victoria v The Commonwealth '). 30 In Polyukhovich , Dawson J said of the external affairs power (at 632): '[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word ""affairs"" is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word ""external"" is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase ""external affairs"".' The reasons for judgment of the other Justices were to similar effect: Mason CJ at 528-531; Deane J at 599-603; Gaudron J at 695-696; McHugh J at 712-714. 31 In Victoria v The Commonwealth, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 485) (footnotes omitted): 'Of course the scope of the legislative power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. The modern doctrine as to the scope of the power conferred by s 51(xxix) was adopted in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth . Dawson J expressed the doctrine in these terms: ""[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word 'affairs' is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word 'external' is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase 'external affairs'."" Similar statements of the doctrine are to be found in the reasons for judgment of other Justices: Mason CJ; Deane J; Gaudron J; and McHugh J. They must now be taken as representing the view of the Court.' 33 Gleeson CJ referred to the plaintiff's argument to the effect that the external affairs power was limited to a power to make laws with respect to relations between Australia and other countries. He said that to accept that argument would involve overruling the decision in Polyukhovich . Gleeson CJ held that Polyukhovich had been correctly decided and he said (at [10]) (footnotes omitted): 'For this argument to succeed, it would be necessary for the Court to depart from the decision in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth , and to decide that the construction placed upon s 51(xxix) by every member of the Court in that case was wrong. In my view, the Court, upon reconsideration, should hold that Polyukhovich was correctly decided insofar as the decision bears upon the question of construction that arises in this case. Insofar as the decision goes beyond that, and bears, for example, upon Ch III of the Constitution , it is not presently relevant and it is unnecessary and inappropriate to say anything further about it. There was a difference between the view of s 51(xxix) taken by Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J, Gaudron J and McHugh J, on the one hand, and the views of Brennan J and Toohey J on the other. That difference does not affect the point presently in issue. Polyukhovich held that the external affairs power covers, but is not limited to, the matter of Australia's relations with other countries. It also includes a power to make laws with respect to places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of, that is, external to, Australia. That conclusion represents the current doctrine of the Court on the external affairs power, and should be maintained because it is correct.' 34 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ said (at [30]) that the modern doctrine of the scope of the power was as expressed by Dawson J in Polyukhovich (at 632). 35 Kirby J identified what he considered to be a number of difficulties with the 'geographical externality principle' and therefore put it to one side. He decided the case by reference to whether the laws were laws with respect to a 'matter of international concern' [66]-[117]. 36 It is well established that the grant of legislative power with respect to external affairs, as with other heads of power, should be construed with all the generality that the words admit. 39 The statement by Dawson J in Polyukhovich refers, among other things, to persons outside the geographical limits of Australia. 40 Clearly, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia might come to Australia from time to time, but I do not think that that means the concept of not being ordinarily resident in Australia lacks an element of externality. To say that a person is not ordinarily resident in Australia means that ordinarily that person is outside the geographical limits of Australia. 41 It follows that one matter, namely, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia, is a matter geographically external to Australia and the other matter, namely, the acquisition of Australian urban land is a matter geographically internal to Australia. 42 The question which arises is whether s 21A(4) and s 4(6)(a) must relate only to matters external to the geographical limits of Australia in order to fall within the external affairs power. If so, this law would fail to meet that test because it only operates when conduct is carried out in Australia, namely, the acquisition of urban land in Australia. The applicant submitted that Polyukovich was authority for the proposition that to fall within the external affairs power a law must deal 'entirely' or 'wholly' with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Dawson J (at 641) and Gaudron J (at 695). The law in Polyukovich did deal entirely or wholly with acts, matters and things geographically external to Australia and it was held to be within the external affairs power. Their Honours' observations are to be read in that context and they are not authority for the proposition that a law only falls within the external affairs power if it deals entirely or wholly with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia. 43 I do not think the mere fact that the law is only engaged if conduct occurs within Australia of itself disqualifies the law from being a law with respect to external affairs. There seems to be no reason to say that simply because the law also relates to conduct in Australia or produces a certain result or effect in Australia that it is not a law with respect to external affairs. I reject the applicant's submission that s 4(6)(a) is invalid because it does not deal entirely with places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of Australia. 44 The applicant submits in the alternative that the relevant provisions are not a law with respect to external affairs because the element of geographical externality is insufficient and because the pith and substance of the relevant provisions is conduct in Australia. 45 The question raised by that submission is not an easy one. It requires a characterisation of the relevant provisions. In Polyukhovich , Deane J said (at 602): 'Whatever may have been the position before the emergence of Australia as a fully independent sovereign State, it should now be accepted that any law which can properly be characterized as a law with respect to any matter, thing or person occurring or situate outside Australia is a law with respect to ""External affairs"" for the purposes of s 51(xxix). In referring to "" a law with respect to any matter ... occurring ... outside Australia"" , I intend to include, among other things, what Jacobs J described (see above) as ""any matter or thing done or to be done or prohibited to be done outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth"". As has been mentioned, that broad view of the scope of the power conforms with settled principles of constitutional construction.' 46 The relevant provisions only operate in relation to a class of persons who are geographically external to Australia. I think this can be said even though the actual criterion is that the person is not ordinarily resident in Australia. They are the only persons affected by the relevant provisions. The location of the class of persons affected by the relevant provisions is an important characteristic of them, albeit that another feature of them is conduct within Australia, that is to say, the acquisition of Australian urban land. In my opinion, for the purposes of determining whether the relevant provisions are a law with respect to external affairs, it is sufficient that the relevant provisions apply only to a class of persons geographically external to Australia. 47 In my opinion, the relevant provisions are a valid exercise of the external affairs power.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.03,0.89,0.9955,6.43225
Case122,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"An effective notice not having been given, the second question is whether the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. The circumstances in which an act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power will invalidate that exercise were considered by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-390 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Their Honours said that the relevant question is not whether the condition is mandatory or directory, but whether, by reference to the language of the relevant provision or provisions and the scope and object of the statute as a whole, it was a purpose of the legislation to invalidate an act done in breach of the condition. 71 In my opinion, by reason of the terms of s 25 , the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. Section 25(1) provides that the section has effect where the Treasurer receives a notice. Section 25(1D) refers to 'advice' given under s 25(1B). The 'advice' is of a decision under s 25(1A) , and a decision under s 25(1A) relates to 'the acquisition ... specified in the notice' and the decision which may be made is that there is 'no objection to the proposal specified in the notice'. Furthermore, the offence of contravening a condition referred to in s 25(1C) is linked to the advice of a decision under s 25(1B). In my opinion, there was no effective decision and therefore advice within the provisions of s 25 because there was no proposal specified in a notice and there was no proposal specified in a notice because the purported notice was not effective for the purposes of s 25(1A). 72 As far as the acquisition which took place in 1995 is concerned, s 25(1D) did not operate as a bar to the respondent exercising the power in s 21A(4). It was the acquisition which took place in 1995 which was relied on by the respondent for the purposes of his decision to make the divestiture order.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.05,0.04,0.91,0.0356,3.1146000000000003
Case123,Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109,"In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616): 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that ""the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case "" . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.'",Criminal Case,Rape,0.125,0.031,0.844,0.9841,6.350350000000001

Case126,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63,"Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.045,0.05,0.905,-0.1394,2.5171

However, it is necessary to elaborate a little on the phrase ""acquisition of property on just terms"". Because s 51(xxxi) operates as a constitutional guarantee, the words ""acquisition"" and ""property"" are to be construed liberally . However, the power conferred by s 51(xxxi) is one with respect to ""acquisition of property on just terms"". That phrase must be read in its entirety and, when so read, it indicates that s 51(xxxi) applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms. It is not concerned with laws in connexion with which ""just terms"" is an inconsistent or incongruous notion. Thus, it is not concerned with a law imposing a fine or penalty, including by way of forfeiture, or a law effecting or authorizing seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. Laws of that kind do not involve acquisitions that permit of just terms and, thus, they are not laws with respect to ""acquisition of property"", as that expression is used in s 51(xxxi). It follows that a law which effects or authorizes forfeiture of property in consequence of its use in the commission of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth stands outside s 51(xxxi).' This passage from the reasons for judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ was cited with approval by five Justices of the High Court in Theophanous v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] HCA 18 at [55] - [56] . 59 The Act controls the acquisition of property in Australia by a foreign corporation or a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia. That control involves power to prohibit a proposed acquisition, to approve a proposed acquisition and, in relation to an acquisition which has taken place without approval, to require a person to dispose of the property acquired. It is difficult to see how the subject matter of the Act could be properly controlled or regulated without the power to make a divestiture order. 60 Having regard to the principles which I have identified, in my opinion ss 4(6) and 21A (4) stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.08,0.049,0.871,0.9162,6.175700000000001

Case134,Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194,"Mr Spencer submitted that he had sought on a number of occasions to suggest a reasonable basis upon which this proceeding could be settled, and that the ACCC had acted unreasonably in refusing to engage with him. He referred to Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 where Hill J summarised the principles that would ordinarily apply with regard to costs when a proceeding has not gone to trial. His Honour said: ""These cases seem to me support the following propositions being made. (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order: Stratford [ J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547] and the SEQEB case [ South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported, Federal Court, 10 February 1989, Pincus J)] . (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits or, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford . This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ( SEQEB ). (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh (1933) 33 SR (NSW) 371. (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd [1973] 1 NSWLR 603 at 606, a case which, however, depended upon the specific working of the statute under consideration.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.088,0.033,0.879,0.9609,6.30815
Case135,Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622,"Mr Spencer also drew attention to a similar statement of principle by McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 626. 19 Mr Spencer argued that he had at all times acted reasonably in relation to the complaint brought against him by the ACCC. When the matter was first drawn to his attention, by a letter dated 14 April 2003 setting out the ACCC's concerns, he had caused his solicitors to reply to that letter, on 20 May 2003, responding in detail to the allegations. On 11 June 2003, the ACCC had written to his solicitors, thanking them for his response. That letter went on to say: ""This office is currently assessing the information provided by you on behalf of your client. However, it is apparent a number of issues remain, therefore as soon as this office has completed its assessment of your response I will contact you to arrange a mutually suitable time to meet with you and your client to discuss this matter further."" 20 It appears from the correspondence that was tendered before me that, despite the suggestion that there would be a meeting between the ACCC and Mr Spencer to discuss the matter further, no such meeting took place. Instead, on 11 August 2004, Deacons, acting on behalf of the ACCC, wrote to Mr Spencer's solicitors informing them that the matter had now been ""fully investigated"" and that the ACCC had determined to pursue it further. The letter went on to say that a proceeding had been instituted in the Federal Court that day, and enclosed a copy of the application and statement of claim.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.033,0.024,0.943,-0.3127,1.8965499999999997
Case136,One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548,"The ACCC submitted that the principles governing the award of costs in cases where a matter does not proceed to a final hearing were correctly expounded by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 553: ""In my opinion, it is important to draw a distinction between cases in which one party, after litigating for some time, effectively surrenders to the other, and cases where some supervening event or settlement so removes or modifies the subject of the dispute that, although it could not be said that one side has simply won, no issue remains between the parties except that of costs. In the former type of case, there will commonly be lacking any basis for an exercise of the Court's discretion otherwise than by an award of costs to the successful party. It is the latter type of case which more often creates problems, since there may be difficulty in discerning a clear reason why one party, rather than the other, should bear the costs. "" 15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J. Although in Smith v Airservices Australia Stone J made no mention of One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation , her Honour's discussion at [48]-[59], under the heading ""Futility"", deals helpfully with the second category of cases that his Honour identified. 32 In my view, this case falls squarely within the first category of case articulated by Burchett J in One.Tel Limited v Commissioner of Taxation .

Case137,Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37,"In broad terms, the Federal Court Rules provide that where a party discontinues proceedings without the leave of the Court, the discontinuing party is liable to pay costs, unless the Court orders otherwise: see O 22 r 2 and 3, and O 62 r 26(1). No such rule is provided for where a proceeding is discontinued with the leave of the Court, although the starting point in principle is that the discontinuing party should meet the costs of the respondent: see Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 ; (2005) 146 FCR 37 per Stone J at [44]. 10 However, the starting point in resolving the issue is this case, namely who should bear the costs when a proceeding has been resolved by the making of consent orders, must be to consider the extent to which the ACCC succeeded in obtaining the relief that was initially sought. In that regard, the position is clear. Mr Spencer consented to the making of declarations by the Court that a series of agreements entered into by Contact Plus constituted ""franchise agreements"" within the meaning of clause 4 of the Code. He also consented to the making of declarations that Contact Plus had contravened the Code and therefore s 51AD of the Act , by failing to provide disclosure documents, and by failing to receive written and signed statements by the franchisees, as required. In addition, he consented to the making of directions regarding the termination of these franchise agreements, and other breaches of the Code. 11 The Court also declared, by consent, that Contact Plus had engaged in conduct that contravened ss 52 and 53 (g) of the Act regarding the representations made concerning the licence fee of $60,000 and the right of a franchisee to an area that was exclusive to that franchisee. Mr Spencer was declared to have aided, abetted, counselled or procured these contraventions of the Act , and to have been directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, those contraventions. 12 A statement of agreed facts was appended to the consent orders that were sought. That statement contains findings of fact for the purposes of s 83 of the Act . 13 Finally, Mr Spencer agreed to injunctions in the terms sought, which would run for a period of three years from the date of the order made. He accepted orders that required him to provide each person with whom Contact Plus had entered into an agreement similar in terms to those of the franchise agreements that were the subject of this proceeding with a disclosure document that complied with the requirements of the Code, and a copy of the orders of the Court. 15 The ACCC contended that the present case fell within the first category described by Burchett J.

The alleged invention, so the argument went, citing Maugham J in Adelmann &amp; Ham Boiler Corporation v Llanrwst Foundry Co (1928) 45 RPC 413 at 420, was simply the application of a well known and well understood piece of mechanism to achieve an obvious advantage.

Similarly in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1996) 35 IPR 296 at 302 Drummond J held that where an equitable title had been converted into legal title by assignment, the assignor would have the right to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date.

Gummow J said: ...(i) first impressions are important in determining whether there is an infringement of a design, (ii) an obvious imitation is one which is not the same as the registered design but is a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences, (iii) the question must be looked at as one of substance and by examining the essential features of the design, (iv) a closer correspondence between the registered design and the alleged infringing design is necessary to satisfy the test of obvious imitation than that of fraudulent imitation, (v) precise mathematical comparisons or matters of measurements or ratios, which form no part of the mental picture which the eye conveys to the brain of shape or configuration suggested by the design, are not to be applied as the test of infringement; appearance to the eye is the critical issue, and (vi) questions of infringement must not be determined by a narrow or overly technical approach in comparison between the design and the alleged infringement, lest the registration be sapped of its worth to the registered owner. 116 As the Full Court in Foggin noted, it is for the Court to rule on the meaning of the design and question of infringement as determined by reference to the eye of the consumer. 117 My first, and continuing, impression is that product B is significantly different in appearance from the Design. In particular the shank is quite different. What is in issue here is an everyday product. To the lay person this looks like a saw, obviously not a hand saw but one with some attachment in the shape of the shank. I regard this as more important than differences in angles and proportions. Put simply, the Design shows a saw blade with a shank; product B is a saw with a different sort of shank. 118 As might be expected experts on either side gave differing views. Professor Redmond thought that the dominant aspect of the Design was the blade and that product B was ""closely similar, such that it has the same appeal to the eye as the design in the (Design)"". He saw the shank as an ""attachment device"" but the saw blade was the ""core or crucial visual element"". The shank was ""peripheral"" or ""of less significance"". Nevertheless I think the ordinary consumer would see a panel saw blade as a piece of metal with teeth along the bottom and a sloping top. The shank is at one end, and thus is in a literal sense peripheral, but it is, and would be seen as, an integral and distinctive part of the article.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.064,0.066,0.869,-0.7873,0.2434500000000006

The test is whether the disclosure in the specification will ""enable the addressee to produce something within each claim without new inventions or additions or prolonged study of matters presenting initial difficulty"": Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [25] . This requirement has been satisfied. 35 The reciprocation frequency and stroke length ranges are matters of guidance for the skilled addressee. They are not essential to the working of the claimed invention. As Maugham LJ said in No-Fume at 248, the specification does not have to define ... all the proportions, or all the dimensions, or all the temperatures, or all the materials which would give a similar or like result. 36 The preferred embodiment makes it clear that only two uses are disclosed. 37 The invention, so far is claimed in any claim, must be useful: Patents Act s 18(1)(c).

Case153,Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287,"In Polyaire Pty Ltd v K-Aire Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 32 ; (2005) 221 CLR 287 the High Court considered the concept of fraudulent imitation under the 1906 Act. Their Honours held (at [36]) that in order to find a fraudulent imitation it was not necessary to show that the differences between alleged infringement and design had been made to disguise the copying. In this respect their Honours at [28] qualified the statement in Malleys Limited v J W Tomlin Pty Ltd [1961] HCA 77 ; (1961) 180 CLR 120 at 127. In Polyaire their Honours at [17] accepted the submission that the application of a ""fraudulent imitation"" requires that the application of the design be with knowledge of the existence of the registration and of the absence of consent to its use, or with reason to suspect those matters, and that the use of the design produces what is an ""imitation"" within the meaning of para (a) [of s 30(1)]. This... is the knowledge, belief or intent which renders the conduct fraudulent. In a footnote to that passage their Honours say: See as to the permissible inference by a jury of fraud against a party who ""wilfully shuts his eyes"" the judgment of Lord Esher MR in English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co Ltd v Brunton [1892] 2 QB 700 at 707-708. 114 As the submissions of Black &amp; Decker appear to accept, the knowledge, belief or intent which does or does not render the conduct fraudulent is that of the Chinese manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who is said to have ""applied"" the Design outside Australia. I see no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Mr Coates. It seems inherently unlikely that the Chinese manufacturer had knowledge of the Australian Designs Act; still less that the Design was registered under it. There is no basis for finding that the manufacturer had reason to suspect such registration.

Case155,Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E &amp; B 327,"However, s 127(1) is not mandatory. Section 127(4) provides that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document (including a deed). As to authority to execute, persons dealing with BDA, including BDI, were entitled to assume that the company's constitution had been complied with and that a director had been duly appointed and had authority to exercise the powers customarily performed by a director of a similar company: s 129(1) , (3), the statutory equivalent of the Rule in Turquand's Case ( Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E &amp; B 327). Section 128(1) provides that a person is entitled to make the assumptions in s 129 and a person is not entitled to make an assumption under s 129 if they knew the assumption was incorrect. While there is no evidence in the present case as to the powers of a director of a similar company to BDA, the onus is on GMCA to establish the contrary. In any event, it seems inherently likely that a director of a company similar to BDA, a wholly owned subsidiary of an overseas company, would have authority to execute on the company's behalf a document of the kind executed by Ms Armstrong. A degree of informality is to be expected. The reality is that Ms Armstrong was not, in the time-honoured expression, engaged on a frolic of her own. 145 In relation to BDI, Mr Pratt was authorized, by virtue of his office, to execute the Deed. The Deed was clearly in the ordinary course of business of BDI in that it dealt with the licensing of intellectual property, which seems to have been BDI's only business. 146 Black &amp; Decker's case is that because the December 2006 Deed made the March 2006 letter of termination ""null and void ab initio"", the 1987 Agreement, as varied by the 2005 Deed, continued uninterrupted. As a consequence, BDA is to be treated as having the status of exclusive licensee from at least the date of the 2005 Deed (its case that such status existed from the 1987 Agreement has been rejected for the reasons already given).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.081,0.022,0.897,0.9605,6.30275

Similarly in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1996) 35 IPR 296 at 302 Drummond J held that where an equitable title had been converted into legal title by assignment, the assignor would have the right to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date.

At [19] his Honour observed: Apart from dealing with obvious practical matters such as comparative costs and the difficulty created by differences in time zones, the cases touch upon some recurring themes: the appropriateness of audiovisual facilities for centrally important evidence, the assessment of credit where evidence is given by audiovisual link, difficulties raised by the use of documents for cross-examination in audiovisual evidence, technological difficulties due to lapse of time between transmission and receipt of questions and answers, and difficulties posed by the use of audiovisual facilities where the cross-examination is lengthy.

I agree with these observations. They illustrate the point that the choice in every case cannot be determined solely by reference to general principles because it is the application of those principles to the facts and circumstances of the particular case which must determine the choice; in the circumstances of a particular case, a matter may point one way and in another case it may point another way. At the end of the day, the exercise of the discretion as to what is appropriate in a particular case will involve a balancing exercise as to what will best serve the administration of justice consistently with maintaining justice between the parties: see Giles CJ in Sunstate Airlines at [4]. The Present Case In the present case, I have come to the conclusion that I should decline to make the direction for the following primary reasons: (1) There is no evidence before me that the Cooling Off Witnesses are not prepared to come to Sydney for the hearing or, through illness or otherwise, are unable to come. I accept that they are not compellable, but 9 of the 12 are still employees of StoresOnline and as StoresOnline will be bearing the cost of all travel and accommodation for all Cooling Off Witnesses, there is no financial disincentive for them in coming. References to their losing commission income while travelling and during their short stay here carries little weight, if any, particularly as it could no doubt be adjusted in their favour, by StoresOnline treating it as a 'one week off', in the 'two weeks on'/'one week off' arrangement for Sales Staff deposed to by Mr Klotz. (2) In my view, the overall savings in cost, by taking the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses by video-link rather than having them come here to give their evidence viva voce , will be at best marginal and at worst more expensive. The savings deposed to by Mr Klotz are, in the scheme of things, not significant and do not take into account all the costs associated with and all the costs which will arise as a result of, recourse to a video-link. It will, as submitted by the ACCC, require the ACCC to have an agent or agents at the remote location or locations to assist in the identification of documents during the course of cross-examination; it will undoubtedly lengthen the time it takes to complete the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses each day will at best be a half day due to time zone differences with attendant increase in the costs incurred for the additional time of counsel and instructing solicitors; and it would be common ground that these latter costs would quickly absorb and overtake any savings as between travel and accommodation costs on the one hand and the direct cost of utilising videoconference facilities on the other. (3) Clearly there are issues of credit involved as between the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the Cooling Off Witnesses and the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the ACCC's witnesses who purchased StoresOnline packages at the relevant Workshops in Australia going to the factual issue of whether or not the purchasers of such packages were told, at any time up to and including the point of sale, about the 'cooling off period'. In my view, it is in the interests of maintenance of justice between the parties that that evidence, from both sides, be given in person. (4) It is also clear that the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses will go beyond their evidence in relation to the 'cooling off period' issue. They will also be cross-examined in relation to other allegations of breaches contained in the statement of claim, as well as on the systems and procedures in place with a view to ensuring compliance with the Undertaking. So understood, their evidence is, contrary to the submission of StoresOnline, centrally important to the outcome of the case. (5) The anticipated size of the Court Book suggests that the Cooling Off Witnesses will be taken to a large number of documents in the course of their cross-examination. I accept that the management of such a task can be effectively handled whilst utilising videoconference facilities albeit, as mentioned above, at an additional significant cost. At one level then, this consideration is central. But where, as here, issues of credit are involved, it impels a conclusion in favour of the evidence being given in person. There are other matters which I have weighed into the balancing exercise in reaching the conclusion I have, in addition to the primary matters referred to in [15] above. On their own, they are not critical. However, as part of the balancing exercise they are, in my view, relevant; for example, the Cooling Off Witnesses are all people who regularly travel, both domestically and internationally, for or on behalf of StoresOnline. While having them travel from the United States to Australia and return will involve them in some 15 hours of travel each way within a relatively short timeframe, this is something to which they are accustomed in the course of their duties. It could not be seen as imposing on them an unusual personal or physical burden. The motion must be dismissed with costs.

Case163,Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1,"No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial. His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6. There have already been other significant delays in this matter in such respects as the hearing of the trial itself (adjourned from July 2006 to November 2006) and mediation of the matter (orders for which were made on 9 August 2006 for the mediation to take place by no later than 20 October 2006, but which did not occur until 2 November 2006). Obviously, as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, issues of case management do not take precedence over issues of justice. However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7. The respondents have sought no consequences as part of an order such as a stay in the event that security for costs are not paid before the commencement of the trial. As observed by Toohey J in James : 'Despite the submission of counsel for the first respondent, an order by way of security without a corresponding stay would be, in reality, no order at all, for no sanction would attach to non-compliance.' (at 446) 8. Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case. The issue here is not that there is a suggestion of impecuniosity of the second applicant, it is whether the delay in bringing the application for security for costs and the proximity of this application to the trial date militate against the exercise of my discretion to grant an order for security for costs in this case. 11 In my view, notwithstanding that the applicants have been ordered at an earlier date to pay security for pre-trial costs, the delays and the proximity to the hearing date of this application for trial costs in my view weigh against the exercise of a discretion in favour of the respondents in relation to this notice of motion.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.123,0.049,0.828,0.999,6.4225
Case164,Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301,"No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial. His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly.

His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6. There have already been other significant delays in this matter in such respects as the hearing of the trial itself (adjourned from July 2006 to November 2006) and mediation of the matter (orders for which were made on 9 August 2006 for the mediation to take place by no later than 20 October 2006, but which did not occur until 2 November 2006). Obviously, as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, issues of case management do not take precedence over issues of justice. However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7. The respondents have sought no consequences as part of an order such as a stay in the event that security for costs are not paid before the commencement of the trial. As observed by Toohey J in James : 'Despite the submission of counsel for the first respondent, an order by way of security without a corresponding stay would be, in reality, no order at all, for no sanction would attach to non-compliance.' (at 446) 8. Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case. The issue here is not that there is a suggestion of impecuniosity of the second applicant, it is whether the delay in bringing the application for security for costs and the proximity of this application to the trial date militate against the exercise of my discretion to grant an order for security for costs in this case. 11 In my view, notwithstanding that the applicants have been ordered at an earlier date to pay security for pre-trial costs, the delays and the proximity to the hearing date of this application for trial costs in my view weigh against the exercise of a discretion in favour of the respondents in relation to this notice of motion.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.123,0.049,0.828,0.999,6.4225
Case168,Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93,"The current position is that the Full Court on Thursday 1 June 2006 ordered that the first and third applicant provide security for the costs of the first and second respondent of the proceeding up to the end of the first day of the trial in the amount of $150 000 by way of unconditional bank guarantee in that sum or otherwise to the satisfaction of the District Registrar of the Queensland District Registry of the Court: Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93. I understand that security for costs was provided on Thursday 22 June 2006. 6 For the purposes of this judgment, I shall assume that the costs order of the Full Court was exhausted on Monday 17 July 2006 which was the first day of the trial, subsequently adjourned. 7 In his written submissions supplemented by oral submissions this morning in Court, Mr McQuade for the respondents submitted in summary as follows: 1. The sum sought by way of security for costs is referrable to the estimate of Mr James McLellan in his affidavit sworn 23 March 2006 and filed 27 March 2006. 2. Otherwise, the respondents rely on submissions and material previously before this Court and the Full Court. 3. The financial position of the first and third applicants is unchanged from April 2006. 4. There is no evidence that security would frustrate litigation and no evidence that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. 5. The onus is on the first and second applicants to raise impecuniosity of those whom litigation would benefit and to prove the facts upon which a contention is founded. 6. The trial will take two weeks. The parties are proposing to call 15 witnesses. 7. The respondents have not adduced any evidence that would weigh against an order for security. 8. There is evidence that the second applicant had an expectation of obtaining further funds to provide by way of security for costs. 9. There has been no delay by the respondents as to the notice of motion for security for costs. It was filed the day following an unsuccessful mediation between the parties. 11. No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial.

The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is ""whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide"": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important.

Case176,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"Save and except for the alleged breaches of the deed of settlement (see the earlier judgment at [15]), all the causes of action in the present proceeding are different from those advanced in the earlier proceeding. Nevertheless, all the causes of action are based on the conduct of the second respondent acting for the first respondent on 27 March 2006 and its aftermath. The doctrine of res judicata may apply in relation to the cause of action in the present proceeding based on breaches of the deed of settlement but it does not apply to the other causes of action in the present proceeding. The doctrine of issue estoppel in the strict sense may apply to those causes of action, although it is difficult to be at all certain because of the lack of coherence in the applicant's pleadings in the present proceeding. The extended doctrine of issue estoppel as articulated in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 (""Anshun estoppel"") certainly applies in relation to all of the other claims and there is no reason they could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding. In the circumstances, the pursuit of the other claims is an abuse of process. 33 I turn now to consider the claim for unlawful discrimination. 34 In his amended statement of claim, the applicant alleges breaches or contraventions by the respondents of ss 5 , 6 , 22 and 24 of the DD Act . Section 22(1) plainly does not apply because, on any view, the alleged discrimination is not of a type which falls within the terms of that subsection. Subsection (2) provides: It is unlawful for an educational authority to discriminate against a student on the ground of the student's disability or a disability of any of the student's associates: (a) by denying the student access, or limiting the student's access, to any benefit provided by the educational authority; or (b) by expelling the student; or (c) by subjecting the student to any other detriment.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.045,0.058,0.896,-0.8658,-0.020299999999999763
Case177,Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188,"The applicant lodged an appeal against the order I made dismissing the proceeding but, on 4 December 2007, the Full Court of this Court dismissed the appeal and ordered that the appellant in the appeal pay the respondent's costs thereof: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188. 12 The applicant then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the orders made by the Full Court but, on 15 May 2008, that application was dismissed. 13 One other point to note about the earlier proceeding is this. Before the present proceeding was instituted, the applicant made a complaint about the respondent's conduct to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (""the Commission"") (as it then was). In the course of a directions hearing in the earlier proceeding held on 14 July 2006, I fixed 17 and 18 August 2006 for the trial of the earlier proceeding. Those dates were subsequently vacated and, as I have said, the proceeding was heard on 5 and 6 October 2006. The point to be made is that at the directions hearing held on 14 July 2006, the applicant said that he had a complaint of ""disability discrimination on the same fact by the University"". He said that the complaint had been lodged with the Commission. He said that the first respondent had asked for an extension of time to respond. The applicant raised the possibility of the proceeding then before the Court (that is, the earlier proceeding) being delayed so that it could be dealt with at the same time as any proceeding following the applicant's complaint to the Commission. In response, counsel for the first respondent said: Your Honour, we sought an extension of time from the Human Rights Commission. Perhaps we ought more properly have explained to them that these proceedings were on foot because, as I understand it, that would forestall the progression of any complaint stage in the Commission, and that is their policy, that is my understanding of their policy. The matter is only at the complaint stage; no proceedings have been issued. ... ... as I understand it the complaint stage needs to be worked through the Commission and examined by the Commissioner before formal proceedings are able to be initiated. We have undertaken mediation unsuccessfully. I think that the parties are some great difference apart in terms of the legal basis of the claim, but the mediation did crystallise some of the issues and we would seek that the matter be brought to trial as expeditiously as possible because we see that the trial is the only way to resolve those matters.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.063,0.065,0.872,0.2263,3.7940500000000004

I will refer to those reasons as the earlier judgment. 9 One point to note, and the relevance of this will become apparent, is that in the course of the earlier judgment I said (at [4]) that I found the applicant ""a most unsatisfactory witness"" and that I did not accept his evidence except where it accorded with other evidence which I accepted.

Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed.

Case185,SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615,"The appellant filed on 2 March 2004 an application in the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. The appellant filed an amended application on 19 October 2004 which raised various grounds of review. The appellant claimed that the Tribunal overlooked some critical points of her case and did not address all the relevant issues she had raised, including whether she was considered a 'traitor' because of the anti-governmental views of her family. The appellant also claimed the Tribunal: failed to ask relevant questions, failed to determine whether the appellant was subject to persecution because of her imputed political opinion, failed to determine the 'particular social group' the applicant belonged to, and failed to enquire as to whether the appellant's past or future conduct would amount to persecution. The appellant also referred the Court below to the decision of SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615 , which was said by the appellant to raise similar issues to her proceedings currently before the Court. 10 The appellant's application below was heard on 22 May 2006, and a further submission was filed on 2 June 2006. Although the appellant did not seek leave to raise that further submission, the Federal Magistrate decided to consider the matters the subject thereof. That submission dealt in substance with the implications of the filing out of time of her application for review, and referred the Court below to judicial precedents purportedly supportive of the appellant's claims in that regard. 11 The Federal Magistrate was satisfied the appellant had established a reasonable excuse for the delay in bringing the application for review. In considering the appellant's substantive claims, the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal did consider the aspects of the appellant's claims and that there was no evidence that any claim to the effect that the appellant was a 'traitor' was ever made to the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate considered the appellant's contention that the Tribunal did not properly consider her claim to be a member of a particular social group. His Honour found this ground could not rightly stand, pointing out at [31] as follows: ""It is well established that a social group cannot be constituted by victims of crime, let alone potential victims of crime, which appears to be the applicant's claim. In any event, the nature of the particular social group claimed by the applicant in the submission was not put to the Tribunal, on the evidence before me"". 12 In line however with what I have observed at [8] above, the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal did adequately address the issue of effectiveness of state protection in the Ukraine of persons such as the appellant. In relation to the authorities cited by the appellant, his Honour distinguished the same on the facts. The Federal Magistrate found that no case for jurisdictional error was made out and dismissed the application. 13 The Federal Magistrate was also of the opinion that there existed strong compassionate reasons based upon and referrable to humanitarian grounds, which relate largely to the circumstances of the appellant's age, single status and family circumstances. 14 The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court raised the following grounds: that the Tribunal failed to assess the appellant's 'claims against proper information' and that the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal misunderstood the appellant's particular social group. 15 The appellant, by way of submissions dated 10 November 2006, submitted that the Tribunal assessed her claims against 'all women advanced in years and living alone in Ukraine'. The appellant contended that the Tribunal should have particularised her social group as 'aged, single women who had relatives overseas, who travelled overseas and who are considered as the ones who had money'. The appellant further submitted that had the Tribunal assessed her claims against that second particular social group, 'it would have no difficulty to accept that [her] claims are Convention-related because there would have been a great deal of independent information consistent with my claims'.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.049,0.066,0.885,-0.9004,-0.1343999999999994
Case186,A pplicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387,"The Minister submitted that the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that a social group cannot be constituted by victims or potential victims of crime 'is consistent with authority that a social group cannot be defined merely by a shared fear of persecution'. In support of that proposition, the Minister referred to A pplicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 at [36] , where Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed as follows: '...the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of ""particular social group"" in Art 1A(2) of the Convention can be summarised as follows. First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large. Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A (59), a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a ""social group"" and not a ""particular social group"". As this Court has repeatedly emphasised, identifying accurately the ""particular social group"" alleged is vital for the accurate application of the applicable law to the case in hand (60).'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.066,0.048,0.885,0.6426,5.2281
Case187,NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1,"Reiterating the reasoning of Scarlett FM, the Minister made the further submission that 'the Tribunal is not obliged to deal with a case not put to it or that does not clearly arise on the material before it', and that the 'social groups suggested by the appellant before His Honour were never put to the Tribunal'. The Minister referred to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs (No2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 in support of that contention. 20 After articulating the Minister's case with his usual precision, and pointing out why no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's reasons for decision could be distilled, in line of course with the Federal Magistrate's decision, counsel for the Minister concluded as follows: 'The social group that the appellant now suggests doesn't fall into either of those categories and, in any event, even leaving those two matters aside, the Tribunal's conclusions as to effective protection in the Ukraine would be another answer to them. Your Honour, plainly there are humanitarian aspects in this case. They were referred to by the learned Magistrate. I'm sure your Honour is fully cognisant of them, but all we can do is draw the remarks of the Magistrate and if your Honour makes any similar remarks, your Honour's remarks to the attention of the Department. Ultimately there is nothing more we can do because it's a matter purely for the Minister.' 21 I find the Minister's submissions persuasive and, consequently, find no error in the Tribunal's decision or that of the Federal Magistrate below. It is also my opinion that the observations made by counsel for the Minister were entirely apposite, and I would wholly endorse what he thus frankly and responsibly indicated. I would respectfully recommend to the Minister that there be a reconsideration of the evident plight of the appellant and the understandable concern and anxiety of her only close relatives, who now live in Australia as Australian citizens. The appellant's case is in my respectful view very strong on compassionate grounds, being an opinion in line with that of the Federal Magistrate below. 22 The appeal must be dismissed. I also make an order, nunc pro tunc, that the Refugee Review Tribunal, which was a party to the proceedings below, be joined as a respondent to the application.

I indicated to Mr Dunstan on that occasion that the notice of appeal simply did not comply with the Rules of Court in relation to the form and substance of such a document, and explained that it was fundamental that there be a notice of appeal in proper form. I then adverted to the fact that legal advice in a situation of this kind is very helpful, if not essential. I also mentioned the possibility of some pro bono assistance. I have given some consideration to that again but I do not think that it is appropriate to take any steps in relation to that.

Case192,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"It is presently important to emphasise, as Hayne J did in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [184] that the development and application of the test of reasonable apprehension avoids the need for a court: ... to attempt some analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the decision-maker. It objectifies what otherwise would be a wholly subjective inquiry and it poses the relevant question in a way that avoids having to predict what probably will be done, or to identify what probably was done, by the decision-maker in reaching the decision in question. 35 Because of the manner in which the case was originally put, it is appropriate to refer as well to the further observation of Hayne J in Jia Legeng (at [185]) that: Saying that a decision-maker has prejudged or will prejudge an issue, or even saying that there is a real likelihood that a reasonable observer might reach that conclusion, is to make a statement which has several distinct elements at its roots. First, there is the contention that the decision-maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case. Secondly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will apply that opinion to that matter in issue. Thirdly, there is the contention that the decision-maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. Most importantly, there is the assumption that the question which is said to have been prejudged is one which should be considered afresh in relation to the particular case. 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four ""elements"" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes.

Case196,R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150,"The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant's contentions are R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150 and R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527. In each case, at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question, the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was ( Eastman ), or subsequently became ( George ), the accused in the proceedings. In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges. In Eastman the contrary was the case and, when the matter was drawn to his attention, the trial judge disqualified himself on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias. As he said (at 153): What distinguishes this application from the application made in R v George is that the warrants were issued by me on the application of one or more police officers so as to facilitate the acquisition of evidence against the accused. In two instances the exercises were successful, because the Crown proposes to lead evidence of having installed listening devices under the authority of two warrants and the evidence thereby obtained. The ground for disqualifying myself is much stronger than that confronted by the trial judge in R v George . In George in contrast, an appeal challenging a conviction of the ground of apprehended bias was dismissed, the Court having regard to the nature of a criminal trial, the various activities in which judges may be involved in the administration of criminal justice and particularly ""to the absence of any association [of the listening device matter] with this particular case.

To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 43 In light of what was said by Gallop J in Eastman , the applicant contends as well that, having made a decision to issue a warrant which required him to form a view of the applicant's recent charge, the Tribunal member ought to have disqualified himself from hearing the subsequent application which required him to form a view of the applicant's conduct and whether he was likely to re-offend. 44 For my own part, I again emphasise that the test to be applied does not require analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the Tribunal. There is no evidence as to whether, if at all prior to his decision the member recalled issuing the warrant involving Mr Islam. Such view as the lay observer might take on that matter, provided it is reasonable, may well be mistaken. That is not to the point. 45 The Tribunal did not disclose at the hearing its participation in the issue of the warrant. The member may well have had no memory of that. The member, equally, may have known or have become aware of that participation but have considered he could or should neutralise the significance of it by determining the matter without taking into account ""in any way"" the 1 May 2008 allegations. Alternatively and despite the significance to be attributed to ""general conduct"" at the stage of exercising the s 501(1) discretion (which could include ""unresolved charges pending a hearing"": Direction No 21, the member may have been of the view that account ought not be taken of the 1 May charge in any event as the applicant had not been convicted as charged. I express no view on any of these speculations other than to say that they would be contingencies which a fair minded lay observer could reasonably canvas in forming his or her judgment of the matter. 51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four ""elements"" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity. 52 As Eastman illustrates, the potential is there for apparent compromise of an official's decision making whenever a close relationship or association exists between the subject matter of an administrative or judicial decision to be taken by that official, and adverse information obtained (or an adverse opinion formed) relating to that subject matter in the course of, or as a result of, a separate earlier decision taken by the same official for other purposes. Where it might reasonably be said that the having of (or having had) that information or opinion by virtue of a prior official decision might compromise the proper and impartial taking of the later decision, the same official ought not participate in the later decision. To do so would involve the member in the discharge, in the circumstances, of incompatible functions. Such was the case here. 53 It was inappropriate for the Tribunal member, having determined to authorise the issue of the warrant in relation to Mr Islam, to have then made the s 501(1) refusal determination given the association in subject matter of the two determinations or at least to have done so without the informed waiver of objection by Mr Islam to his so doing. Absent such waiver, I am satisfied that the ""double might"" test of the fair minded lay observer would inevitably be satisfied. 54 I have emphasised the complex of competing possible views, that the conduct of the Tribunal member, the course of the hearing and the Tribunal's decision, could reasonably engender in the lay observer. In my view, despite the Tribunal's and, for that matter, the Minister's disclaimers, such an observer could reasonably entertain an apprehension that the Tribunal's decision might have suffered from prejudgment. The closely associated decision-making that occurred here ought not be countenanced. The Tribunal should have procedures to guard against such a possibility.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.055,0.052,0.893,-0.1144,2.5966000000000005

Case198,Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88,"It is unnecessary to refer separately here to the applicable principles other than to note, as I do below, the applicant's primary reliance on the decision of the High Court in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88. 39 As I earlier indicated, the two grounds of this application are that, first, the Tribunal's decision was affected by reasonably apprehended bias and, secondly, denial of procedural fairness. As to the latter ground, as formulated in the application it was that: 4.2.1 The issue of whether the applicant had committed a criminal offence on 1 May 2008 was credible, relevant and significant to the decision on whether or not to affirm the refusal of the visa. As such, the Tribunal was required, as a matter of procedural fairness, to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to information regarding the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008. 4.2.3 During the hearing of the application before the Tribunal on 28 November 2008 the Tribunal repeatedly denied the applicant an opportunity to provide a detailed or adequate response to the allegation that he had committed an offence on 1 May 2008. 40 During the course of the hearing there was some movement in, and a coming together of, the grounds. This will become apparent in what follows. (a) Apprehended Bias 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 49 On both of these issues the reasonable and fair minded lay observer could well consider he or she was being asked to, but was unable to, accept that the Tribunal could satisfactorily bifurcate the information it might possess on both those matters, and that it could reach its conclusion on each by reference, for example, to the three bail breaches while not taking into account in any way the view it had of the significance and character of the 1 May 2008 charge derived from the listening device hearing. While the significance of ""subconscious effect"" is to be treated with circumspection in procedural fairness cases given the relevant inquiry in such cases: cf Applicant VEAL at [19]; the issues of appearance and judgment in apprehended bias cases are, in my view, differently appointed. They do involve an appeal to the good sense and experience of the reasonably informed and fair minded lay (not judicial ) observer. 50 If the lay observer might experience some difficulty or reserve in accepting the potential efficacy of a self imposed ""Chinese wall"" in containing a prior formed opinion, that would well be compounded by the somewhat Delphic character of the Tribunal member's concluding comment on the November 2007 warning from the Minister about ""any further conduct bringing him within the provisions of s 501"": Unfortunately this warning appears to have not been taken seriously. 59 Unlike in Applicant VEAL both the Tribunal and the applicant were aware of the charge and of its being disregarded. As Mr Islam indicated when told it would be so treated ""I appreciate it"" it was to his advantage. What Mr Islam did not know and was not told, was of the member's participation in the issue of the warrant. The non-disclosure of that participation did not of itself raise a procedural fairness issue. It did set the scene, though, for the applicant's apprehended bias challenge. 60 I will order that: 1. The application be allowed. 2. The decision of the Tribunal be set aside. 3. The matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. 4.

Case204,The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453,"submission of Santos, Delhi Petroleum and the State that the application has no reasonable prospects of success is, in summary: (a) the Applicants do not seek a determination of native title in the present proceeding; (b) the definition of ""future act"" in s 233(1) of the NTA is that it is an act which, apart from the NTA, either validly affects (in the sense that word is to be understood in light of in s 227 of the NTA) native title in relation to the land or would, if valid, affect native title; (c) in light of Full Court's judgment in The Lardil Peoples v Queensland [2001] FCA 414 ; (2001) 108 FCR 453 ( Lardil ), to secure final relief of the kind sought by the Applicants it is not sufficient to establish only that an act might affect native title if native title were found to exist; (d) a corollary of this is that mere status as a registered native title claimant can never supply the requisite element in the definition of future act, which is also an element in any entitlement to the relief sought. The Applicants, in summary, make the following submission in response: (a) Lardil is distinguishable because it related to procedural rights conferred by s 24HA and s 24NA of the NTA and not the right to negotiate under Subdiv P of Div 2 of Pt 3 of that Act; (b) in any event, the declaration that the grant of a petroleum lease would not constitute a pre-existing rights based act does not require the Applicants to establish that they have native title because, if there is no valid ATP, it necessarily follows that there could be no valid grant of a petroleum lease. The latter submission entails some exploration of the ability of this Court to make any pronouncement in relation to the validity of an administrative actions arising only under State law. That is best considered in conjunction with the separate, jurisdictional challenge which Santos and Delhi Petroleum make. Lardil is not distinguishable. To the contrary, that case confirms, in a binding way, what a reading of the definition of ""future act"" in s 233 of the NTA would in any event suggest. That is, materially, that a future act is one which ""affects"" native title, not an act which, if native title existed, ""might"" affect it. To construe the definition in the latter way would, as French J (as the Chief Justice then was) observed in Lardil (at 473, [59]), ""require a re-writing of the statutory definition in s 233 which would significantly alter the operation of the act. Such a course is not justified by the language of a statute"". Similar sentiments are evident in the judgments of the other members of the Full Court in Lardil see p 476, [70] per Merkel J and p 486, [114] per Dowsett J. The ""right to negotiate"" claimed by the Applicants forms part (Subdiv P) of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA. Regard to the overview of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA, offered by s 24AA, also exposes the flaw in the Applicants' position. Thus, s 24AA(1) accurately informs the reader that Div 3 ""deals mainly with future acts, which are defined in s 233"" and that, "" Acts that do not affect native title are not future acts; therefore this Division does not deal with them "" (emphasis added). In turn, s 24AA(2) of the NTA offers the accurate general observation that, ""to the extent that a future act affects native title, it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the Division, and invalid if not"". These general propositions, evident from the overview of Div 3, are expressly articulated in s 24OA of the NTA, which provides: 24OA Future acts invalid unless otherwise provided. Unless a provision of this Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title. This section does not attend with invalidity a future act which might affect native title, were the same to exist. As in Lardil , the relief sought by the Applicants is final relief in a proceeding where no claim for native title is advanced. They rely on their status as the ""registered native title claimant"". Yet the advancing and successful vindication of a native title claim, not status as the ""registered native title claimant"", is, given the definition of ""future act"", just as central to the application of provisions upon which the Applicants rely as it was to those under consideration in Lardil . To seek to distinguish Lardil on the basis that the rights within Div 3 of Pt 2 with which that case was concerned were ""procedural rights"" ignores this centrality. For the purposes of s 31A of the FCA Act the Respondents have established that the Applicants have no reasonable prospect of securing any of the declaratory and injunctive relief which they seek, insofar as they rely on other than State law for any part of that relief. Jurisdiction &amp; Standing Section 81 of the NTA confers on the Court jurisdiction to hear and determine applications that ""relate to native title"". Read in isolation and as a matter of first impression and language, the jurisdiction conferred by this section appears to require nothing more or less than a relevant connection between the subject matter of an application and native title. In Lardil though (108 FCR at [156] and [68]), the conclusion was reached, after a consideration of the context in which s 81 appears in the NTA, that the section confers jurisdiction only in respect of applications under Pt 3 of that Act. This is not such an application. Perhaps recognising this, the Applicants did not point to s 81 as a source of jurisdiction to entertain their application. Instead, they adverted to s 213(2) of the NTA, to s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act) and to s 21 of the FCA Act. Subject to the operation and effect of the other provisions of the NTA, s 213(2) confers jurisdiction on the Court ""in relation to matters arising under the Act"". For its part, s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act confers jurisdiction with respect to ""matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament"". The reference to s 21 of the FCA Act as a source of jurisdiction is misconceived. That section operates where some other provision has conferred original jurisdiction on the Court and, in such circumstances, empowers the Court to ""make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed"". In other words, s 21 is a source of power, not jurisdiction. Common to each of s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 213(2) of the NTA is that the jurisdiction they confer is confined to the ""matters"" which those sections respectively specify. No point was taken in Lardil as to the absence in that case of a ""matter"". In the present case the amended statement of claim contains the following allegations: The applicants on behalf of the Wongkumara People are the registered native title claimant within the meaning of s 253 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA) in respect of land in south-west Queensland and north-west New South Wales, which land (""the Claimed Land"") is more particularly described in attachment B to Native Title Determination Application QUD52 of 2008 (as amended by leave granted by Dowsett J on 12 April 2008). The first respondent and third respondent are recorded in the register kept under s 80A of the Petroleum Act 1923 (Qld) (the Petroleum Act ) as the holder of an Authority to Prospect (ATP) 259P dated 31 January 1979 pursuant to the Petroleum Act in respect of land in south-west Queensland (the ATP Land), which land lies wholly within the boundaries of the Claimed Land. The second respondent is a Government party within the meaning of s 26(1) of the NTA for lands and water within the state of Queensland. 3A. Since the grant of ATP 259P the first and third respondents have prospected and continue to prospect for petroleum on the ATP Land including the Claimed Land. From about late 2005, representatives of the Wongkumara People and of the first respondent on behalf of the itself and the third respondent and other companies being joint venture partners of the first and third respondents have been engaged in negotiations for an indigenous land use agreement (""the proposed ILUA"") under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA), which negotiations relate, inter alia, to proposed future acts under the NTA in respect of the Claimed Land covered by the ATP. 4A. The proposed ILUA is to replace an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (""the former ILUA"") that was part of an Implementation Agreement dated 16 January 2001 and which was in force for a term of five years. 4B. The former ILUA was never registered under the NTA. In the course of negotiations for the former ILUA and for the proposed ILUA the first respondent on behalf of itself and its joint venture partners has claimed that because ATP 259P predates the NTA and the grant of a petroleum lease under the Petroleum Act is a pre-existing rights based act (PERBA) within the meaning of Subdivision I of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and as such is not subject to the right to negotiate provisions of Subdivision P of Division 3 of Part 2 of the NTA and should not be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 4 November 2005 from the first respondent to representatives of the Wongkumara People. The applicants have maintained that they are entitled to the right to negotiate under the NTA in respect of the grant of petroleum lease over the Claimed Land covered by the ATP and that the grant of a petroleum lease should be part of the negotiations for the proposed ILUA. Particulars Clause 9.4 of the former ILUA Letter dated 18 June 2008 from Eddy Neumann Lawyers, solicitors for the applicant, to the first respondent. ATP 259P was originally issued on 31 January 1979 for a term of four years commencing n 1 January 1979. From time to time thereafter, the term of ATP 259P has purportedly been varied, extended or renewed. Particulars (a) 22 December 1982: variation by which the term was renewed for four years commencing on 1 January 1983. (b) 18 December 1986: variation by which the term was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 1987. (c) 7 May 1991: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1991. (d) 20 September 1995: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1995. (e) 24 June 1999: renewal by which the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 January 1999. (f) 12 December 2003: variation by which the term of the ATP was extended for four years commencing on 1 January 2003. (g) 3 January 2008: renewal by which the term of the ATP was renewed for a term of four years commencing January 2007. Read with the relief sought by the Applicants, the amended statement of claim offers, in my opinion, a paradigm example of an impermissible attempt to secure an advisory opinion. What is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the Applicants, who claim in other proceedings, but have not yet been determined to hold, native title in respect of the claimed land and Santos and Delhi Petroleum who may one day seek to obtain from the State a petroleum lease in respect over part of the claimed land on the strength of ATP259P. It is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted. In effect, what the Applicants seek is advice as to whether, were it to be determined that they hold native title and were a petroleum lease to be sought by and granted to Santos or to Delhi Petroleum by the State, that lease, if otherwise valid, would be an invalid future act if the negotiation requirements found in Subdiv P of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the NTA were not complied with? The hypothetical nature of the application is self evident. To adapt the language employed by Zamir I and Lord Woolf in the passage quoted, the question would only be whether the Applicants, Santos and Delhi Petroleum were generally obliged to act in a certain way? Before anything more meaningful than an answer to that question could be given, the legal and factual issues just mentioned would have to be determined and occur. In Lardil (at 490, [136]), Dowsett J expressly adverted to the question of whether the Applicants in that case had standing to pursue the claim for relief insofar as it sought a declaration of invalidity under State law. His Honour doubted that they had standing. Nonetheless, he went on to consider the State law question, ultimately concluding that the decision sought to be impugned was valid. Of the other judges, French J, in the minority as to this aspect of the case, was of the view that there was no jurisdiction to determine the State law question. Though Merkel J expressed his agreement with the conclusion reached by Dowsett J as to the validity of the decision under State law, his Honour did not, in terms, expressly extend that agreement to the doubt as to standing which had been expressed by Dowsett J. In Lardil , the majority concluded that the Court had jurisdiction to decide the State law question of the validity of an act under that law because deciding that question was an essential step in any determination of whether there was a ""future act"" under the NTA. Here, the Applicants have commenced an application not materially distinguishable from Lardil which, in light of that case, is doomed to fail with respect to its Federal aspects. The essential connection with the Federal question provides the only jurisdiction which the Court could have to decide the State law question. In those circumstances, if there were jurisdiction to entertain the Federal question, the deciding of the State law question would be a matter of accrued jurisdiction in respect of which s 23 of the FCA Act would operate so as to confer jurisdiction. In light of Lardil and the fact that the present case is not materially distinguishable from that authority, the present case was doomed to fail. The Federal law aspect of the application was therefore, in the sense the term is used in the cases ""colourable"". That has the consequence that there is no jurisdiction to entertain the State law aspect of the claim, even if the Applicants had standing. Exercise of Discretion In the event that the foregoing conclusions are wrong, I should nonetheless not be disposed to the grant declaratory relief in respect of so much of the claim as remained and relied for its foundation on the State law question of whether it was lawfully possible to grant petroleum leases on the strength of ATP 259P. That would turn on a question as to whether on the particular dates pleaded there was a power of renewal in the Petroleum Act or otherwise under State law. Lardil indicates that jurisdiction would, in these contingent circumstances, exist to determine such a question in the accrued jurisdiction.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.07,0.024,0.906,0.9984,6.4483999999999995
Case205,Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257,"root authority in respect of what constitutes a ""matter"" for the purposes of a law conferring Federal jurisdiction is Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257. In that case (at 265) the following pronouncement was made in relation to s 76 of the Constitution : It was suggested in argument that ""matter"" meant no more than legal proceeding, and that Parliament might at its discretion create or invent a legal proceeding in which this Court might be called on to interpret the Constitution by a declaration at large. We do not accept this contention; we do not think that the word ""matter"" in sec. 76 means a legal proceeding, but rather the subject matter for determination in a legal proceeding. In our opinion there can be no matter within the meaning of the section unless there is some immediate right, duty or liability to be established by the determination of the Court. If the matter exists, the Legislature may no doubt prescribe the means by which the determination of the Court is to be obtained, and for that purpose may, we think, adopt any existing method of legal procedure or invent a new one. But it cannot authorize this Court to make a declaration of the law divorced from any attempt to administer that law. Put shortly, the giving of an advisory opinion is antithetical to an exercise of Federal jurisdiction. The Applicants do not (and could not) contest that the relevant test reposes in this pronouncement. Rather, they submit that, in terms of the course of authority with respect to that pronouncement, a ""matter"" does exist. They point to the existence of present negotiations and submit that there is an issue between them and the Respondents, evident from the relief sought, which is and will remain real and not hypothetical unless and until: (a) Santos and Delhi Petroleum disclaim any right to have the State grant to them as a pre-existing rights based act a petroleum lease in respect of the claimed land under the Petroleum Act or indicate that they will not be seeking the grant of such a lease; or (b) The State indicates that it agreed with the Applicants that the grant of such a lease was not a pre-existing rights based act and that it would not grant such a lease to Santos and Delhi Petroleum.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.145,0.025,0.83,0.9921,6.3523499999999995
Case206,Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394,"and Delhi Petroleum contend that there is an absence of any pleading in this case of material facts giving rise to a specific dispute. In that absence, they submit, is to be found a crucial difference between a ""matter"", albeit one arising in respect of conduct yet to take place, in which declaratory relief may permissibly be sought in the exercise of Federal jurisdiction and the seeking of such relief on a purely hypothetical basis. An example of the presence of such a difference telling against the existence of jurisdiction is, they submit, to be found in Australian Institute of Private Detectives Ltd v Privacy Commissioner [2004] FCA 1440 ; (2004) 139 FCR 394 ( Private Detectives Case ).",Criminal Case,Rape,0.109,0.021,0.87,0.8519,5.89365
Case207,Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334,"Private Detectives Case is but a particular example of the application of the principles expounded in the joint judgment in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 as to the means of differentiating between a permissible invocation of judicial power and the impermissible posing of an academic or hypothetical question. That exposition is of particular importance because of the way in which ""matter"" has come to be understood for the purposes of Federal jurisdiction. The following propositions emerge from that exposition: (a) The purpose of a judicial determination is the making of a conclusive or final decision based on a concrete and established or agreed situation which aims to quell a controversy (at 355, [44]); (b) In light of that purpose, courts have traditionally refused to provide answers to hypothetical questions or to give advisory opinions (at 355-356, [47]); (c) It does not violate this proposition for a declaration to be sought as to whether conduct which has not yet taken place will not be in breach of contract or a law (at 356, [47]); and (d) The crucial difference between the seeking of such a declaration and an advisory opinion is whether what is sought is based on a concrete situation as opposed to being divorced from the facts (at 356, [48]). The last of these propositions was illustrated by the High Court in that case (at 356, [48]) by reference, with evident approval, to the following passage from Zamir I and Lord Woolf, The Declaratory Judgement, (2 nd ed, 1993) at 132: ""If ... the dispute is not attached to specific facts, and the question is only whether the plaintiff is generally entitled to act in a certain way, the issue will still be considered theoretical. The main reason for this is that there may be no certainty that such a general declaration will settle the dispute finally. Subsequent to that declaration a person (the defendant himself or someone else) may be adversely affected by a particular act of the plaintiff. It may then be doubtful whether this act is covered by the declaration. In such a case the affected person will probably be entitled to raise the issue again on its special facts. Indeed, such a declaration will in effect be a mere advisory opinion."" [Emphasis in original] In the Private Detectives Case (at 401-402, [29]-[32]) Sackville J analysed the nature and effect of the pleaded case in the following way: In the present case, a reading of the Statement of Claim makes it plain that the Institute seeks the declarations it claims independently of any specific factual allegations. The pleading does not allege that the Institute or its members have sought specific information from an identified organisation for a particular purpose. Nor is it alleged that the organisation denied the request by reason of a particular provision of the Privacy Act or determination of the Commissioner. As I have noted, the Institute seeks no relief in respect of any refusal by the Commissioner to make a determination under s 72 of the Privacy Act. The Statement of Claim merely alleges that the Institute 'through its members' undertakes investigations on behalf of clients in connection with 'litigation, potential litigation and matters related to litigation' and that the investigations involve obtaining personal information from organisations which record the information for their own business purposes (pars 4, 6). It is then said that the Privacy Act proscribes the disclosure by organisations of personal information to the Institute and its members unless the disclosure is 'required or authorised by or under law'. The Statement of Claim does not identify the circumstances in which particular investigations have taken place, the organisations requested for information or the particular use to which the information was intended to be put. The difficulty is not that declarations sought by the Institute go merely to future events or circumstances. The difficulty is that they cannot quell any existing controversy between the Institute and the Commissioner. The first declaration, before it can be meaningful, requires a number of factual and legal issues to be determined. It must be established that the disclosing entity is an 'organisation' within the meaning of the Privacy Act and that the organisation is subject to the National Privacy Principles. The disclosure must be of 'personal information', as defined in the Privacy Act . It also must be for the purpose of enabling the Institute or a member to investigate on behalf of citizens in corporations 'matters concerning litigation, or potential litigation' (whose purpose is not made clear). The second declaration creates the same difficulties. The conclusion which his Honour reached as a result of that analysis (at 402, [32]) was that, ""in effect, the Institute seeks an advisory opinion from the Court without reference to any concrete facts"". That conclusion was fatal for the Applicant Institute in that case. Applying the propositions evident in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd , Sackville J held that the proceeding did not involve a ""matter"" and hence that the Court lacked jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to entertain the Institute's claim for declaratory relief.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.081,0.06,0.858,0.9634,6.3479

While the position would be different if they had the benefit of a native title determination in their favour or even if the relief were sought in the context of an application for a determination of native title, the Applicants are strangers to any dealings between the State and Santos and Delhi Petroleum with respect to the granting of a particular petroleum lease. Their mere status as a registered native title claimant does not, in my opinion, give them standing to claim any of the relief sought, including any part which relies only on State law.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.178,0.016,0.806,0.9745,6.24875

Case215,Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411,"is one thing; whether or not it is appropriate to exercise it is another. There is no right to declaratory relief. In Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411 Gzell J of the New South Wales Supreme Court referred (at [81]) to the undesirability of the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"" in litigation. In refusing, as a matter of discretion, to grant declaratory relief in respect of a goods and services tax controversy not yet the subject of an assessment his Honour referred with approval to the following observation made by Young J in McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Ltd (1988) 13 NSWLR 303 at 312: The plaintiff's summons asks for a declaration that the yacht is the property of the plaintiff. I do not believe that such a declaration should be made. Declarations should not be made as a staging post in litigation, and in a case where some executive orders have to be made, it is usually best to proceed to consider those executive orders rather than making declarations. I share the diffidence of Young J and Gzell J in relation to the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"". On behalf of Santos and Delhi Petroleum it was submitted that the declarations sought by the Applicants in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Amended Application were staging posts to the end of an assertion in the future of a right to negotiate. I agree that this is, in any event, the true way of conceiving the declarations sought. Therefore, even if for that reason alone, I should not be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to grant that relief. Outcome Given the conclusions which I have reached, the appropriate course to take in the circumstances is to dismiss the application. The alternative suggested, striking out of the amended statement of claim, is not appropriate. The only way to address the fundamental jurisdictional difficulty presently attending the application would be to plead a claim for native title. That would be pregnant with a potential for embarrassment derived from different findings given that the Applicants already claim a native title determination in respect of the claim land in other proceedings in the Court. Further, I have in any event concluded that it is not appropriate, as a matter of discretion, to grant the declaratory relief sought. For these reasons, I should not be disposed to allow any such amendment.

Case216,McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Ltd (1988) 13 NSWLR 303,"is one thing; whether or not it is appropriate to exercise it is another. There is no right to declaratory relief. In Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411 Gzell J of the New South Wales Supreme Court referred (at [81]) to the undesirability of the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"" in litigation. In refusing, as a matter of discretion, to grant declaratory relief in respect of a goods and services tax controversy not yet the subject of an assessment his Honour referred with approval to the following observation made by Young J in McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Ltd (1988) 13 NSWLR 303 at 312: The plaintiff's summons asks for a declaration that the yacht is the property of the plaintiff. I do not believe that such a declaration should be made. Declarations should not be made as a staging post in litigation, and in a case where some executive orders have to be made, it is usually best to proceed to consider those executive orders rather than making declarations.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.149,0.041,0.809,0.9723,6.292050000000001
Case217,Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571,"this case there is evidence that the respondent has sold or attempted to sell Super Bubble to third parties. 24 Prima facie , it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicant's patent. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried. Irreparable harm In both written and oral submissions, the applicant has asserted: 1. The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as 'Glareshield'. According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich, the National Sales Manager for the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant, accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia. 2. Already two of its shed customers, Action Garages and another entity identified as Coastal Garages, are no longer purchasing Glareshield from the applicant's New South Wales distributor, however these customers continue in business. The applicant believes that at least one of these former customers is purchasing Super Bubble from the respondent. 3. The applicant's New South Wales licensee has suffered losses in excess of $30 000 for the period March to May 2006, which losses are also affecting the business of the applicant. 4. The threat to the loss of sales of Glareshield may result in a diminished ability of the applicant to undertake research and development which would place the ongoing viability of the applicant at risk. From the evidence presented this morning it is likely that damages in this case would be an inadequate remedy should the applicant be successful at trial. Alleged 'poaching' of customers by the respondent, the importance of the Glareshield product to the applicant's business, and goodwill associated with the product indicate that irreparable harm is a possible consequence of continuation of the respondent's activities. I also note the submission of the applicant that the respondent appears to have a paid-up capital of $10, rendering a damages award potentially worthless. Balance of convenience Through the affidavit of Mr Scott Gibson, the managing director of the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, the applicant has offered an undertaking as to damages in the event of success in obtaining interlocutory relief. In view of this undertaking, in addition to the harm the applicant says that it is experiencing from the respondent's conduct and the fact that there is a serious question to be tried, the relief sought by the applicant is appropriate. COSTS The applicant has made a number of submissions to me in relation to costs in this matter. In essence the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis, or, alternatively, an order under Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3, that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. Indemnity costs In oral and written submissions Mr Logan for the applicant relied on two points in support of an order for indemnity costs. First, the applicant relied on what it describes as a pattern of deliberate and calculated conduct in cynical and flagrant disregard of the applicant's intellectual property rights which has resulted in the need to appear before me today. Counsel cited Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 56 as authority that pre-litigation conduct may be considered in the context of determining whether the circumstances as a whole warrant the making of an indemnity costs order. Second, citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225, the applicant states that where an applicant has commenced a proceeding in circumstances where, properly advised, it should have known that there was no chance of success then that is a circumstance which would justify an indemnity costs order. Counsel for the applicant submits that, by analogy to a respondent , such order would be justified where there is no defence asserted, but the respondent continues its conduct so as to put the applicant in a position where it can do nothing other than commence proceedings and incur substantial expense in mounting an interlocutory relief application, where, in effect, properly advised it ought always to have known that there was no answer to the application. Whilst I note the applicant's submissions in relation to indemnity costs I am not persuaded at this stage that this is a case in which there are special or unusual features such as to justify the Court departing from the ordinary practice. Whilst I accept that there is a serious question to be tried and that an interlocutory injunction should be granted I am not of the view that, in the absence of submissions from the respondent, I can be certain that the respondent has no defence and is acting in such a way as having its only purpose ensuring the applicant incurs substantial expense. I note that the respondent currently has different legal representatives to those which were retained when the applicant first commenced raising concerns with the respondent over the patent, and apparently the parties have been engaged in discussions over the past few weeks. I am unaware of how long its current legal representatives have been acting on the respondent's behalf. In these circumstances I am not of the view that an order for costs on an indemnity basis would be just and appropriate. Order 62 rule 3 In oral submissions, Mr Logan pressed that a costs order of some nature ought to be made today and that this is a case where an order allowing the applicant to tax its costs forthwith is warranted. The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred. Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides: 'An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order.' I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. I note the observations of Emmett J in Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571 where his Honour considered the rationale for the rule: 'The rationale for such a provision appears to me to be that, since an interlocutory proceeding does not resolve the final issue between the parties, it would, in ordinary circumstances, be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately, as that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding. The general principle appears to be that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded, and the rights of the parties have been finally determined.' The rule, of course anticipates that there will be some circumstances where the general principle should be diverted from. As discussed earlier in this judgment I am not persuaded that this is a case where the applicant has incurred significant additional costs by reason of the respondent's conduct in respect of this litigation. While the respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today. While the applicant has incurred considerable costs in this matter in relation to its intellectual property rights the situation is not one of special circumstances such as to divert from the general principles. The future course of this litigation may shed more light on the conduct of the respondent such as to justify special orders as to costs however, in my view, having not had the benefit of submissions from the respondent today, the appropriate order is that the issue of costs be reserved. CONCLUSION It is unfortunate that the respondent has not appeared today. However in view of the evidence presented by the applicant, I am persuaded that it would be appropriate to grant the applicant the interlocutory relief it seeks. In oral submissions, the applicant pressed for permanent relief to be granted by the Court today. However I am not persuaded on the facts that it would be an appropriate order. Notwithstanding the failure of the respondent to appear today, I note that the matter has been treated by all parties and indeed conducted by the applicant in the lead up to the hearing this morning as an application for interlocutory relief. On that basis, it is reasonable to presume that the respondent was expecting to have its day in court when the application for permanent relief was heard. Accordingly, I make orders as follows: 1. Upon the undertaking of the applicant: (a) to submit to such order (if any) as the Court may consider to be just for the payment of compensation, in an amount to be assessed by the Court or as it may direct, to the respondent should it be found that it has been adversely affected by the operation of the interlocutory order set out in par 2 below or any continuation (with or without variation) thereof; and (b) to pay such compensation referred to in par 1(a) above and as directed by the Court; 2. Until the trial of this proceeding, or further order, an interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondent whether by itself, its directors, officers, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever during the term of Australian Innovation Patent No 200310063 ('the patent') or any extension thereof from infringing the patent, including by the importing, making, offering to make, selling, offering for sale, disposing of, offering to dispose of, using, or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the insulation product known as Super Bubble, or authorising the doing of any of those acts. 3. Costs be reserved. I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

There must be a serious question to be tried or a prima facie such that if the evidence remains the same there is a probability that at a final hearing it will be entitled to relief. 2.

Case220,Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) FCAFC 220,"I have already noted, the applicant is the registered proprietor of a patent which has been certified and remains in force. In order to establish infringement of the patent, the applicant must show that the respondent has taken each and every one of the essential integers of the relevant claims. This principle was considered by the Full Court in Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) FCAFC 220 at par 49 where their Honours said, referring to the earlier Full Court decision in Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 37: 'There is no infringement if the patentee has, by the form of the claim, left open what the alleged infringer has done. Their Honours [in Populin] stated, as a fundamental rule, the test for infringement as set out in Rodi &amp; Wienenbirger AG v Henry Showell Ltd [1969] RPC 367 that there will be no infringement unless the alleged infringer has taken all of the essential features or integers of the patentee's claim.

The principles relevant to the exercise of that power are: 1. There must be a serious question to be tried or a prima facie such that if the evidence remains the same there is a probability that at a final hearing it will be entitled to relief. 2. The applicant will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not be an adequate compensation, unless an injunction is granted. 3.

Their Honours [in Populin] stated, as a fundamental rule, the test for infringement as set out in Rodi &amp; Wienenbirger AG v Henry Showell Ltd [1969] RPC 367 that there will be no infringement unless the alleged infringer has taken all of the essential features or integers of the patentee's claim.

Case228,Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821,"This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Phipps FM): Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821. In hearing and determining the appeal, I am exercising the powers of the Full Court pursuant to a determination by the Chief Justice under s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 2 Phipps FM dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice served on him by the respondent. Before the Magistrate, the appellant put forward three bases for the setting aside of the notice. 3 The first basis was that the notice was based on a debt that had been paid. 24 Leaving aside the gratuitous insult in ground (h), the Magistrate was hardly obliged to deal with an issue that was not raised before him. It follows that I also do not need to deal with it. Grounds (b) and (h) must fail. In any case, I agree with what Hayne J said to the appellant about the issue in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2004] HCATrans 562: ""These arguments are variants on arguments that have sometimes been put in the Court. They are arguments that always end up proving far too much, Mr Moran, as they are arguments that, if they had any legs which they do not it would demonstrate that there was no ownership of land, there was no Corporations Law, and the arguments of a kind commonly deployed to demonstrate that somebody does not owe taxation. It always proved too much."" 25 Ground of appeal (c) relates to the note. It must also fail. 26 The Magistrate said at [5] that: ""A promissory note does not constitute payment for costs, It was returned by [solicitors for the respondent] by return mail in which they said it did not constitute legal tender. A promissory note cannot constitute payment in the absence of acceptance of the promissory note or agreement that payment is to be made by promissory note. Neither of those two things exist here. In addition, there is no evidence of an ability to satisfy the promissory note. Finally, it needs to be said, the order for costs made by the Court of Appeal contained no stay, nor did the Master's order fixing the amount of the costs. The promissory note, on its face, is payable at 4pm on 31 January 2025. ...""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.082,0.839,-0.3757,1.6880499999999998
Case229,Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223,"According to the appellant, grounds of appeal (a) and (g) fix on what the Magistrate said at [15] and [16]: ""[The appellant] is seeking to satisfy the Court that he has a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as those terms are used in s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). It is not sufficient for a debtor to assert that he has a claim and then set out the basis for the claim. He must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand. The Court must be satisfied it has a reasonable prospect of success. I refer to Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [52] as one of the authorities for that proposition. The debtor must show that he has a prima face case even if he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case (Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 at 350). The [appellant] does not show that he has a claim to pursue. He has attempted to establish a claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria and the proceeding has been dismissed. He has lodged an appeal against the decision of Mandie J, but that does not establish that his claim has any merit or any prospects of success, whether he has a prima facie case or a reasonable prospect of success."" As noted at [6], the appeal against the decision of Mandie J is stayed pending the provision of security for costs. 12 Ground of appeal (a) is misconceived. The Magistrate did not ""assume the outcome of [that] appeal"". He did what the authorities (ie Bhagat and Ebert ) called upon him to do: namely, make an assessment solely for the purposes of the application before him of the prospects of success of the appeal. In making that assessment, he did not purport to decide the outcome of that appeal: the Court of Appeal is not bound to agree with that assessment if and when it comes to decide the appeal.

Case231,Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511,"As to the first proposition set out at [14], the appellant contends that the Magistrate cannot exercise the jurisdiction of a state court. (Presumably, that contention is made in reliance on Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511.) However, the Magistrate did not purport to do that. All he did was record as part of the task described at [12] what Master Evans had said about the claim. In so doing, he referred to an affidavit of Robert McGirr of solicitors for the respondent which reference is the subject of the second proposition set out at [14]. However, the appellant relied on Mr McGirr's affidavit before the Magistrate having exhibited it to an affidavit of his own. It does not lie in the appellant's mouth to now complain that Mr McGirr's affidavit was used against him even if he only intended to rely on it in some respects and not others. 17 Grounds of appeal (e) and (f) relate to the substance of the claim which the Magistrate described at [8] to [11]. 18 According to the appellant, ground of appeal (e) fixes on what the Magistrate said in the last sentence at [12]: ""The only avenue open to [the appellant] was as a lessee, but that would only be if his lease was granted with the approval of the first mortgagee, which it was not."" The appellant complains that this amounts to a ruling on a crucial issue in the claim: namely, who was the first mortgagee of a property located at Clarkes Hill that was sold by the respondent.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.044,0.006,0.949,0.8582,5.9627

Case235,Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 46 ; (1982) 150 CLR 160,"The majority also referred to the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 ( Fontana Films ) . The majority said at [163]: Gibbs CJ pointed out [Fontana Films [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 615] that, like the aliens power (s 51 (xix)), the corporations power is conferred ""by reference to persons"". He continued [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 181-2; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616]: However, having regard to the federal nature of the Constitution , it is difficult to suppose that the powers conferred by pars (xix) and (xx) were intended to extend to the enactment of a complete code of laws, on all subjects, applicable to the persons named in those paragraphs ... [I]n the case of the corporations described in s 51 (xx), extraordinary consequences would result if the Parliament had power to make any kind of law on any subject affecting such corporations ... Other difficulties in relation to s 51 (xx) are caused by the need to construe the Constitution as a whole, and thus to reconcile par (xx) with other parts of s 51. Although Gibbs CJ concluded [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that it was both unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to define the outer limits of s 51(xx) , he did say [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] that: The words of par (xx) suggest that the nature of the corporation to which the laws relate must be significant as an element in the nature or character of the laws, if they are to be valid ... In other words, in the case of trading and financial corporations, laws which relate to their trading and financial activities will be within the power. As to foreign corporations, he added [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 183; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616-17] that ""the fact that the corporation is a foreign corporation should be significant in the way in which the law relates to it"". 16 The majority noted in [165]: ... the statements made by Gibbs CJ about laws relating to the trading and financial activities of trading and financial corporations being within power are to be understood as responding to the arguments advanced in that case. They are not to be read as attempting an exhaustive statement of the ambit of the power. Gibbs CJ explicitly denied [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 at 182; [1982] HCA 23 ; 40 ALR 609 at 616] any intention of doing that. That said, it must be recognised that Gibbs CJ emphasised the importance of giving due weight to the words ""foreign"", ""trading"", and ""financial"" in considering the application of s 51(xx). 25 The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.)

That, however, is a specialized meaning of the word. The present primary meaning is much wider, covering as it does the pursuit of a calling or handicraft, and its history emphasizes rather use, regularity and course of conduct, than concern with commodities. 132 Counsel for the Etheridge Shire Council submitted the activities of the council in the following areas, constituted trading: Operation of the Terrestrial Centre.

[It may be recalled that Section 36 of the LGA provides that local governments in Queensland may enter into contracts and charge for services at facilities it supplies, and s 29 of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 provides that the Chief Executive of Main Roads may enter into contracts for the State of Queensland with other persons, including local governments, for the carrying out of road works on a state controlled road.] 133 Mr K. Watson of Counsel, for the Etheridge Shire Council, submitted as his primary submission that, as at 21 October 2006, these activities together with ""the receipt of investment income"" either alone, or some, or all in combination, were significant or substantial trading and financial activities of the Etheridge Shire Council, and with the consequence that the Etheridge Shire Council was an ""employer"" pursuant to s 6 of the WRA.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.023,0.007,0.97,0.5574,4.9349
Case237,Commonwealth v State of Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam Case) [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1,"The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8.

Case240,Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570,"The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]. 69 The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2.

The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7.

This leaves entirely outside the range of federal power, as being in themselves objects of the power, all those domestic corporations, for instance, which are constituted for municipal, mining, manufacturing, religious, scholastic, charitable, scientific, and literary purposes, and possibly others more nearly approximating a character of trading; a strong circumstance to show how and to what extent the autonomy of the States was intended to be safe-guarded.

Case248,New South Wales v Commonwealth (Work Choices Case) [2006] HCA 52 ; (2006) 229 CLR 1,"On 14 November 2006, the High Court delivered judgment in New South Wales v Commonwealth (2006) 229 CLR 1 ; [2006] HCA 52 ( Work Choices Case ) concerning the validity of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) (the Work Choices Act) as enacted in December 2005. The Work Choices Act changed the constitutional basis for the WRA. As a consequence of the Work Choices Act, the WRA is now substantially an exercise of the corporations power under s 51(xx) of the Constitution , rather than an exercise of the conciliation and arbitration power under s 51(xxxv). 5 The WRA, as amended, defines ""employee"" in s 5(1) as an individual so far as he or she is employed, or usually employed, by an employer as defined in s 6(1). 6 ""Employer"" is defined in s 6(1) as meaning: (a) a constitutional corporation, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (b) the Commonwealth, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (c) a Commonwealth authority, so far as it employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (d) a person or entity (which may be an unincorporated club) so far as the person or entity, in connection with constitutional trade or commerce, employs, or usually employs, an individual as: (i) a flight crew officer; or (ii) a maritime worker; or (iii) a waterside workers; or (e) a body corporate incorporated in a Territory, so far as the body employs, or usually employs, an individual; or (f) a person or entity (which may be an unincorporated club) that carries on an activity (whether of a commercial, governmental or other nature) in a Territory in Australia, so far as the person or entity employs, or usually employs, an individual in connection with the activity carried on in the Territory. 9 The High Court in the Work Choices Case , by a majority of five to two, held that the Work Choices Act was valid. The majority concluded that the understanding of the power conferred by s 51(xx) as explained by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ in Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323 ; 128 ALR 81 ; [1995] HCA 16 ( Re Dingjan) and amplified by Gaudron J in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2000) 203 CLR 346 ; 172 ALR 257 ; [2000] HCA 34 ( Pacific Coal ) should be adopted. 17 The majority in the Work Choices Case , in seeking to determine the ambit of laws which apply to constitutional corporations, referred to the dissenting members of the Court in Re Dingjan [1995] HCA 16 ; (1995) 183 CLR 323. The majority said, at [177]: ... Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J (with which Deane J agreed). Her Honour's reasoning proceeded by the following steps. [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. First, the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations, and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia. Second, it follows that the power conferred by s 51(xx) extends ""at the very least"" [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111] to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships. Third, once the second step is accepted, it follows that the power ""also extends to the persons by and through whom they carry out those functions and activities and with whom they enter into those relationships"". [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. 21 If it is, the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s 51(xx) as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal , would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council; the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council; the imposition of obligations on it; and, in respect of those matters, the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees, and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business. 23 The constitutional framework erected by the Constitution referred to in the majority judgment in the Work Choices Case set out at para [12] above, including the observation from the Melbourne Corporation case, emphatically denies that possibility. 24 In the Work Choices Case , the majority of the High Court noted, at [9]: The term ""constitutional corporation"" is defined in s 4 to mean a corporation to which s 51(xx) of the Constitution applies. That paragraph refers to foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. No doubt there may be room for dispute, in relation to some corporations, about whether they are constitutional corporations within the meaning of the new Act. However, in the application of para (a) of the basic definition of employer, and the corresponding definition of employee, to a given corporation, the hypothesis is that it is a constitutional corporation. 28 Subsequent to the judgment of the High Court in the Work Choices Case , the Australian Workers Union of Employees, Queensland (the applicant), filed an application in this Court on 6 December 2006. Subsequently, an amended application, which included the Queensland Services, Industrial Union of Employees as the second applicant, was filed on 22 December 2006. That application sought ""declaratory orders pursuant to s 21 of The Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)"" declaring: ... the respective rights of the parties regarding a purported Workplace Agreement lodged by the First Respondent with the Second Respondent, purportedly in reliance upon sections 342 , 344 and 345 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on the 21st October 2006, and described as ""Etheridge Shire Council Australia (Employee Collective) Workplace Agreement 2006"" (hereinafter called ""the Etheridge Agreement""). 29 The applicants sought that: It be declared: (i) that the First Respondent is not an ""employer"" within the meaning of section 6 of the Workplace Relations Act ; (ii) that the First Respondent was not lawfully entitled to lodge the Etheridge Agreement with the Second Respondent on 21 st October 2006, or at any time thereafter, under Part 8 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ; (iii) that the Etheridge Agreement did not come into operation as a workplace agreement in accordance with section 347(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on 21 st October 2006, nor any time thereafter. (iv) that the Etheridge Agreement has no force and effect as a workplace agreement under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ; 30 On 5 February 2007, in proceedings QUD 39 of 2007, the State of Queensland sought similar declarations. 78 The observations of the High Court in the Work Choices Case , at [157] and [158] set out in [13]-[14] above, contrasts the view of the majority in St George City Council that the question of characterisation is to be determined by the purpose for which the corporation is formed, with the dissenting view of Barwick CJ that the ""activities test"" determines the character of a corporation, and that ""a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services"" was a trading corporation. 79 The comment by the majority in the Work Choices Case that the view of Barwick CJ ""did not then command the assent of the majority of the Court"" is to be understood as indicating that the ""activities test"" propounded by Barwick CJ was later accepted by the High Court in Adamson as the applicable test, and is the proper test to apply. 80 Mason J, in Adamson, said of a ""trading corporation"": Essentially, it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.051,0.007,0.942,0.995,6.4384999999999994

Case251,R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533,"There are further observations in the judgment of the majority which have a relevance to the present controversy. The majority said at [157]: By the time Fontana Films came to be decided, there had been controversy about what are ""trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth"". In particular, in R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; [(1974) 130 CLR 533 ; 2 ALR 371] , the court had held that a county council, established under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) for ""local government purposes"", empowered to sell electricity and sell and install electrical fittings and appliances, and pursuing only those activities, was not a trading corporation. In his dissenting opinion, Barwick CJ had said [1974] HCA 7 ; [(1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543] that ""a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services"" was a trading corporation. But this view did not then command the assent of a majority of the court. 14 The majority continued at [158]: In R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] [Adamson] St George County Council was distinguished. Associations incorporated under associations incorporation legislation, whose principal objects were the promotion, control and management of Australian Rules football matches, were held to be trading corporations. Mason J said [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 at 233; [1979] HCA 6 ; 23 ALR 439 at 472]: ""Trading corporation"" is not and never has been a term of art or one having a special legal meaning. Nor, as the Chief Justice pointed out [in St George County Council ], was there a generally accepted definition of the expression in the nineteenth century. Essentially it is a description or label given to a corporation when its trading activities form a sufficiently significant proportion of its overall activities as to merit its description as a trading corporation. 48 The High Court decision of The Queen v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex Parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 ( St George County Council ) is not directly on point, but, in my opinion, is of assistance on the question of characterisation, when one contrasts the powers and activities the subject of consideration in that case, with the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council in the present case. 49 In that case, the St George County Council was established under the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) for ""local government purposes"". It was empowered within its district to supply electricity and to supply and install electrical fitting and appliances, and these were its only activities . The Act provided that the county council should ""endeavour so to conduct each trading undertaking that without any loss being incurred the service, product, or commodity of the undertaking may be supplied to the consumer as cheaply as possible"". 50 The High Court, by a majority (McTiernan, Menzies and Gibbs JJ, with Barwick CJ and Stephen J dissenting) held that the St George County Council was not a ""trading corporation"" within s 5 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-1972 (Cth). The majority accepted that the St George County Council was not a ""trading corporation"", notwithstanding that it carried on trading activities. 51 It was submitted on behalf of the State of New South Wales, intervening, that a ""trading corporation"" connotes more than a corporation which trades. It was submitted that ""trading"" describes the nature or quality of the corporation itself rather than its actual activities. For the Commonwealth of Australia, it was submitted that the St George County Council was set up to sell electrical fittings and appliances, and that to do that was to trade. It was therefore a ""trading corporation"". It was submitted that ""[I]ts actual activities characterize it."" 52 Barwick CJ said, at 538: The question raised by the case involves the construction of the expression ""trading corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth"" as it appears in the Act through the definition for the purposes of the Act of a ""corporation"". Because of identity of language and the fact that the statutory formula is designed to keep the Act within constitutional power, that construction would be applicable to the words of the Constitution , a circumstance which must influence the construction placed on the statutory formula. I ought to point out at the outset that the ultimate question in the case is to be answered in relation to the applicant and not as to all county councils. The powers and functions which under the Act may be transferred to a county council are diverse (cf., e.g. s. 564(1) and (2)). Consequently, considerations which, in my opinion, are definitive in this case may not be so in the case of other county councils with different powers and activities. (Emphasis added). 53 Importantly, Barwick CJ noted, at 539: ... the description ""trading corporation"", in my opinion, refers not to the purpose of incorporation but to the activities of the corporation at the relevant time. So far then the applicant is evidently a corporation which has been formed within the Commonwealth. It trades in the supply of electricity, of electrical appliances and of electrical services. It has no other purpose or activity. 54 Barwick CJ suggested that there did not appear to have been any generally accepted definition of a trading corporation. He said, at 541: It was assumed, I think, that such a corporation could be identified by its activities. If its nature was being sought, it was to be found in what it did. 55 Barwick CJ said, at 543: To say that a corporation's description for relevant purposes will be determined by its activities does not mean, of course, that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation. It is evident that the legislative power given by s. 51(xx.) is not a power to legislate with respect to trading. It is a legislative power with respect to some corporations. But a corporation whose predominant and characteristic activity is trading whether in goods or services will, in my opinion, satisfy the description : and a corporation which does nothing but trade and, if it matters, was incorporated so that it could trade, i.e. exercise the trading powers of the constituent local government councils, is, in my opinion, properly described as a trading corporation within the constitutional power. It seems to me that the reason why a corporation trades as its sole or predominant and characteristic activity is irrelevant to the description of the corporation for present purposes, that is to say, the ends which such a corporation seeks to serve by trading are irrelevant to its description. As I have indicated, the purpose of the grant of legislative power includes the control of the corporate activities of the corporation : it is not so concerned with the motives which prompt those activities, nor the ultimate ends which those activities hope to achieve. If, upon that consideration, the corporation can fairly be described by reason of those activities, their extent and relative significance in the affairs of the corporation as a ""trading corporation"" it will, in my opinion, be nothing to the point that it is also a government or State or municipal corporation. The effect of the trading activities of such a corporation upon and in the community will not be lessened or necessarily affected by the fact that it is a State or municipal instrumentality. (Emphasis added). 56 The first and fourth sentences of this passage identify the basis for his conclusion that, in that case, St George County Council was a trading corporation. 57 Relevant to the contention of the union applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 that the Etheridge Shire Council is a municipal corporation, a tier of State government in its own right, and therefore cannot be also a constitutional corporation, Barwick CJ said, at 544-545: It may be granted that the applicant may properly be styled a ""municipal"" corporation; it is both the creature and servant of ""local government"": but it is, none the less, in my opinion, a trading corporation within the statutory definition. It is easily demonstrated that the purpose of the applicant's incorporation and of its activities is the performance of what has come to be regarded as a local government function, its charter being to provide electricity at low cost to the ratepayer. But it is to achieve and satisfy this purpose by trading, both in electricity and in electrical goods and services. It buys and sells an activity recognized by the Act itself as ""a trading undertaking"" (s.418(1) and (2)). To say that it is a ""municipal"" corporation is, in my opinion, to say no more than that it is a government, or local government, agency; or, put another way, that it is a municipal trading corporation. 58 Menzies J in the majority said, at 551: The submission of the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth, who appeared for the respondents, was that the Council is and has always been a trading corporation. He relied exclusively upon the contention that this Council had been established for no purpose other than to trade and he refrained from submitting, in these proceedings, that a local government corporation which has local government purposes other than trading purposes is a ""trading corporation"" within the meaning of s. 5. (Emphasis added). 59 Later, at 551, Menzies J said: It is because trading of a council is subordinate to its governmental purposes that the Act contains a section such as s. 419. It is this subordination of trading to community purposes that is, to my mind, the real importance of s. 419 in this case. It reveals the very nature of a council to which it applies. 60 Menzies J said, at 552: It seems to me that trading corporations were in 1900 a well-recognized classification of companies. 62 Gibbs J (as he then was) said, at 561: The question ... is whether the County Council is a trading corporation. In my opinion, the words ""trading corporation"" in s. 51(xx.) do not mean ""a corporation which is trading"". The word ""trading"" forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers. It is common to describe corporations according to their nature, and to speak, for example, of ecclesiastical, eleemosynary or municipal corporations. There can be no doubt that the words ""foreign corporations"" and ""financial corporations"" in pl. (xx.) describe corporations of a particular kind rather than corporations of any kind which happen to act in a particular way. The same is true of the words ""trading corporations"" which, in their natural meaning, as well as in the context of the placitum, refer to corporations of a particular kind. 63 At 562, his Honour said: A trading corporation is one formed for the purpose of trading. However, as I have indicated, the mere fact that a corporation is trading does not mean that it is a trading corporation. It is necessary to determine the true character of the corporation, upon a consideration of all the circumstances that throw light on the purpose for which it was formed. Thus there is no difficulty in holding that the fact that a corporation carries on some trade which is merely incidental or ancillary to the fulfilment of its main purpose does not give it the character of a trading corporation. 64 Gibbs J said, 564: When all these facts are considered, the proper conclusion in my opinion is that the County Council is a corporation constituted for the purposes of local government to provide an essential service to the inhabitants of an aggregation of local authority areas, under conditions thought most likely to prove beneficial to them. It is properly described as a municipal corporation. The description to the corporations to which the powers of s. 51 (xx.) extend does not include municipal corporations. 65 Gibbs J went on to say, at 565: It seems to me that the purpose of specifically mentioning the corporations intended to be within the power given by s. 51 (xx.) was to exclude from the scope of the power at least those corporations which could properly be characterized as municipal and charitable corporations. ... The purpose of its [the County Council's] formation is more properly described as that of fulfilling a function of local government. 66 Stephen J, who formed a minority with Barwick CJ in St George County Council , was of the view that, (at 570-571): ... when a corporation is formed for the sole purpose of undertaking that [trading] function and undertakes none of the functions of local government which typify the activities of a municipal corporation it is ... inappropriate to describe it as a municipal corporation. 67 The High Court in Adamson , which was differently constituted from the High Court in St George County Council, departed from the purposive reasoning of the majority in St George County Council and favoured the reasoning of Barwick CJ in that case. 68 In Adamson , Barwick CJ said, at 208: The only sure guide to the nature of the company is a purview of its current activities, a judgment as to its nature being made after an overview of all those activities. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 73 What his Honour referred to in paragraph 3. above may have an important relevance to a ""fully fledged"" municipal corporation, like the Etheridge Shire Council, as opposed to what might be described as an ersatz municipal corporation that was the subject of consideration in the St George County Council case. 74 As a practical matter, his Honour concluded that the WACA was a trading corporation, but reached a different conclusion in relation to the Cricket Clubs. At 25, he highlighted some difficulties: Where all activities are income producing, it may not be hard to single out some as trading activities and quantify their significance, even if only in a broad way. But where some activities are income producing and others are not, the exercise is not so straightforward ... A trading activity may represent a significant part of a club's income but be relatively insignificant in an overall consideration of the club's activities. 75 This observation has a particular resonance in the present case, as will appear later. Such trading activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is quite insignificant in relation to the overall consideration of the activities of the Etheridge Shire Council, which, as a local government, exercises extensive legislative and executive functions in the local government area, and is its raison d'&ecirc;tre. 81 With respect, there is an element of circularity in this observation, but it is not consistent with the view of Barwick CJ in the St George County Council case, set out in [55] above. 82 It is to be noted that Gibbs J in the St George County Council case, said, at 561: The word ""trading"" forms part of a composite expression and indicates the essential attribute of the kind of corporation to which it refers. It is common to describe corporations according to their nature ... 83 And later, in the same paragraph: ... the words ""trading corporations"" ... in their natural meaning, as well as in the context of the placitum, refer to corporations of a particular kind. 84 Both Barwick CJ, at 543, and Gibbs J, at 561, thoroughly rejected the contention that a corporation which to any extent engages in trade is a trading corporation. 85 I therefore proceed to enquire whether the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation or a financial corporation, by considering whether, on the evidence, ""the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is trading, whether in goods or services"", or whether ""the predominant and characteristic activity of the Etheridge Shire Council is in finance."" 86 In that enquiry, it is necessary to have regard not only to whether the predominant and characteristic activity of the Council is trading or finance, but also, as Barwick CJ indicated in St George County Council at 543, the extent of that activity and its relative significance in the affairs of the Etheridge Shire Council. 87 The Etheridge Shire Council is established by the LGA, and the powers and activities of the Etheridge Shire Council are governed by that Act. 88 The Etheridge Shire Council was established as a body corporate (in the name Einasleigh Shire Council) in accordance with the Local Government (Divisional Boards) Act 1879 (Qld) by proclamation notice of which was published in the Queensland Government Gazette dated 11 November 1879. 142 Menzies J in St George County Council , said, at 552: In Halsbury's Laws of England ... the distinction between trading and non-trading corporations is conveniently drawn and corporations having statutory powers of local government are included in the classification there appearing of non-trading corporations. It may also be observed that in 1850 James Grant in his Treatise on the Law of Corporations classified ""Municipal Corporation"" separately from trading bodies and devoted 150 pages of his book to the consideration of municipal corporations. 143 His Honour concluded, at 554: It is not my purpose to attempt to define all that falls within the limits of the classification of ""trading corporation"". Rather, I am concerned to indicate that the classification has limits and those limits are not to be ascertained simply by asking the question ""Does the corporation trade?"" As I have indicated, many corporations which do trade are clearly outside the limits of the classification and one group of corporations that is not comprehended is, in my view, corporations of an essentially different character, namely corporations for local government purposes."" 144 Mr Herbert of Counsel for the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 drew attention to the record of the constitutional debates on 17 April 1897, at 793, where Mr Symon said, ""In the original Act corporations simply are mentioned. Why this difference?"" To which Mr Barton, later an original judge of the High Court, said: The reason of making the difference was this: It having been seen that the word ""corporations,"" as it existed, covered municipal corporations, the term was changed to ""trade corporations."" 145 In 1891, in the Constitutional debates on whether the corporations power should extend to the registration or incorporation of companies, Sir Samuel Griffiths said, at 686: I do not think we should. There are a great number of different corporations. For instance, there are municipal, trading, and charitable corporations, and these are all incorporated in different ways according to the law pertaining in different states. ... It is sometimes difficult to say what is a trading corporation. What is important, however, is that there should be uniform law for the recognition of corporations. 146 In the light of the observations by the High Court in Adamson and the later cases, in the characterisation of a corporation as a trading corporation, or a financial corporation, the primary focus has to be on the activities of the corporation. 154 I am of the view that all five judges in the St George County Council case would have determined that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation. 155 Accepting that the ""activities test"" is the appropriate test to apply in determining whether local governments are trading corporations, the application of that test points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the Etheridge Shire Council is not a trading corporation. 156 Equally, it is not a financial corporation. The only financial activities which, on the evidence, it engages, is maintaining interest-bearing deposits of funds prior to their utilisation for the purposes of the shire council.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.065,0.011,0.924,0.9997,6.44495
Case252,R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190,"The majority continued at [158]: In R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] [Adamson] St George County Council was distinguished.

It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.

The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.049,0.008,0.942,0.9856,6.4056

The majority concluded that the understanding of the power conferred by s 51(xx) as explained by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ in Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323 ; 128 ALR 81 ; [1995] HCA 16 ( Re Dingjan) and amplified by Gaudron J in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2000) 203 CLR 346 ; 172 ALR 257 ; [2000] HCA 34 ( Pacific Coal ) should be adopted. 17 The majority in the Work Choices Case , in seeking to determine the ambit of laws which apply to constitutional corporations, referred to the dissenting members of the Court in Re Dingjan [1995] HCA 16 ; (1995) 183 CLR 323. The majority said, at [177]: ... Particular reference need now be made only to the reasons of Gaudron J (with which Deane J agreed). Her Honour's reasoning proceeded by the following steps. [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111]. First, the business activities of corporations formed within Australia signify whether they are trading or financial corporations, and the main purpose of the power to legislate with respect to foreign corporations must be directed to their business activities in Australia. Second, it follows that the power conferred by s 51(xx) extends ""at the very least"" [1995] HCA 16 ; [(1995) 183 CLR 323 at 365; [1995] HCA 16 ; 128 ALR 81 at 111] to the business functions and activities of constitutional corporations and to their business relationships.

Case254,"Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] HCA 34 ; (2000) 203 CLR 346","The High Court in the Work Choices Case , by a majority of five to two, held that the Work Choices Act was valid. The majority concluded that the understanding of the power conferred by s 51(xx) as explained by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ in Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner (1995) 183 CLR 323 ; 128 ALR 81 ; [1995] HCA 16 ( Re Dingjan) and amplified by Gaudron J in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2000) 203 CLR 346 ; 172 ALR 257 ; [2000] HCA 34 ( Pacific Coal ) should be adopted. 18 At [178], the majority of the High Court said: This understanding of s 51(xx) was subsequently amplified by Gaudron J in her reasons in Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd: Ex parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275; [2000] HCA 34] where her Honour said: I have no doubt that the power conferred by s 51(xx) of the Constitution extends to the regulation of the activities, functions, relationships and the business of a corporation described in that sub-section, the creation of rights, and privileges belonging to such a corporation, the imposition of obligations on it and, in respect of those matters, to the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees and shareholders and, also, the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business. [footnote omitted] This understanding of the power should be adopted. It follows, as Gaudron J said, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275; [2000] HCA 34] that the legislative power conferred by s 51(xx) ""extends to laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations"". 19 The majority concluded, in [198]: ... A law which prescribes norms regulating the relationship between constitutional corporations and their employees, or affecting constitutional corporations in the manner considered and upheld in Fontana Films or, as Gaudron J said in Re Pacific Coal, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275] ""laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of [constitutional] corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations"" are laws with respect to constitutional corporations. 20 In essence, the High Court, by a majority, concluded that the Work Choices Act was valid in its application to constitutional corporations. The central question in these two proceedings is whether the Etheridge Shire Council is such a corporation. 21 If it is, the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s 51(xx) as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal , would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council; the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council; the imposition of obligations on it; and, in respect of those matters, the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees, and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.073,0.0,0.927,0.989,6.3885000000000005
Case255,State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282,"The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]. 69 The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution.

It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 147 I note, nonetheless, that in the State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 , Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ said, at 303: ... [T]he decision in Adamson is of importance for two reasons. First, the majority of the Court (Barwick CJ, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ), rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation. 148 This passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the ""sole"" or ""principal"" criterion for the purposes of characterisation. The passage suggests, however, that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process. 149 The contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence, including the historical evidence concerning the function of the Etheridge Shire Council, in particular, the fundamental functions of the shire council, being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area, it is impossible to conclude that the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation. 150 I have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council. 151 All of them, in my opinion, including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council, after close analysis, entirely lack the essential quality of trade. Almost all of them run at a loss. They are all directed, in my view, to public benefit objectives within the shire. Their scale, even in monetary terms (putting to one side the non-monetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council), are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the Council as to the deny to the Council the characterisation of a ""trading corporation"" or a ""financial corporation"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.035,0.02,0.945,0.9588,6.3408

In doing so, Griffith CJ said, at 983: In my opinion, the legislature has deliberately and intentionally made the local authority, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, the sole judge of such matters, subject only to this qualification, that, if a by-law is such that no reasonable man, exercising in good faith the powers conferred by the Statute, could under any circumstances pass such a by-law, it might be held invalid on that ground as being an abuse of the power, and therefore not within it. 44 The Etheridge Shire Council has numerous other powers and responsibilities under the LGA, including making a local law which creates an offence constituted by contravening a local law and fixing a penalty for an offence against a local law: s 26 of the LGA. 45 Having regard to the submissions of counsel for all the parties, it is plain that if the Etheridge Shire Council is not a constitutional corporation, then each of the applicants is entitled to the relief which it seeks.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.099,0.056,0.844,0.7717,5.65495

Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits. 18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies. 19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.04,0.042,0.918,-0.1416,2.5064

Case267,Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518,"Austin J in Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518 said: [20] Effectively, the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is an offsetting claim is the same as the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is a genuine dispute between the alleged debtor and the party claiming to be creditor. The most effective cited description of the standard for establishing a genuine dispute is a passage in the judgment of McLelland CJ in Eq in Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787. There, his Honour said that the expression ""genuine dispute"" connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of considerations as the ""serious question to be tried"" criterion which arises in an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. [21] It is of fundamental importance for parties to proceedings of this kind to understand that the court does not enter into the merits of any dispute between the parties. The court merely satisfies itself, to the standard described by McLelland CJ in Eq, that the dispute, or the assertion of an offsetting claim, is ""genuine"". If it is, then the statutory demand procedure is out of place. The whole purpose of the reforms introduced to corporate insolvency law, when the present Pt 5.4 was introduced, was to remove litigation about disputed claims from the winding up process. That is why courts have said, time and again, that if a creditor is aware that there is a dispute, asserted on behalf of the alleged debtor with sufficient plausibility to meet that relatively low threshold described by his Honour, issuing a statutory demand is wholly inappropriate. The correct course is to have the dispute resolved by proceedings asserting the debt.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.11,0.098,0.791,0.8439,5.938650000000001

'Good faith' means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful. In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss, the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated. If such evidence is entirely lacking, the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s 459H.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.141,0.067,0.792,0.9186,6.1411

Second, the statute contemplates a summary procedure, the only outcome of which will be an order affecting the statutory demand, not an order or judgment declaring a debt to be owing or not to be owing or ordering payment of any money sum. Third, the only significance that the statutory demand has is that if there is a failure to comply with it then the company is deemed to be insolvent. Thus the demand is no more than a precursor to an application for winding up in insolvency. Fourth, an application to wind up in insolvency must be determined within 6 months (unless the court is satisfied that special circumstances justify an extension of that time): s 459R. Firth, on the hearing of the application to wind up, the company may not oppose the application on grounds that it might have taken in any application to set aside the demand, unless those grounds are material to proving that the company is solvent. 11 Hayne J then said: These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute.

Case274,Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 222,"The power given to the Court under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to forbid or restrict the publication of evidence should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Section 50 makes it clear that the power should only be exercised in order to prevent ""prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth"". In the present case ASIC's concerns relate to prejudice to the administration of justice. It is a fundamental principle of the administration of justice in Australia that the administration of justice be open justice. When considering whether to exercise the power given by s 50 a Court must bear in mind the need to do justice between all relevant parties, taking as its initial position the principle of open justice. The manner in which a Court should approach an application under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to restrict the publication of evidence was considered by a Full Court of the Federal Court in Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 222. The Full Court said at pars [14] and [15]: ""The public interest, that the Court should effectively endeavour to achieve in considering the exercise of power under s 50, is the object of doing justice between the parties. That is the function that the Court is appointed to discharge. Where refusal to make an order might well undermine or defeat the purpose of achieving justice between the parties, and disappoint the public interest in having the Court deal responsibly with the affairs of citizens, it may be appropriate to make an order pursuant to s 50 ... The Court must, however, take into account what s 50 does not explicitly state, but is the underlying assumption upon which it is based, namely, the principle of open justice. The importance of the principle of open justice is not in doubt. On the other hand, the possibility of prejudice to the administration of justice must be weighed against the public interest in maintaining open justice. Although the principle of open justice is of great importance in exercising the discretion under s 50, it is not necessarily the whole weight of that principle that must be placed on the scales. The derogation from the principle that might be involved in making an order under s 50 may be very great, or it might be very small. The degree of derogation from the principle involved in the proposed order is an important matter to be considered in balancing the principle against possible prejudice to the administration of justice ...""

Case275,Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417,"The basis upon which the Court should approach an application under s 17(4) of the Federal Court of Australia Act is similar to the approach it should take in relation to an application under s 50. The power to order the exclusion of persons from a hearing should only be exercised in exceptional cases. It is clear from s 17(4) that that power should only be exercised in circumstances where not to exercise it would be ""contrary to the interests of justice"". The primary principle is that the principle of open justice is to be observed in that Court hearings should be open to the public and only closed where the interests of justice require that closure. As Earl Loreburn said in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 445: ""The inveterate rule is that justice shall be administered in open Court.""

Case276,Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones [1985] 2 NSWLR 47,"In Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones [1985] 2 NSWLR 47, Kirby P (as he then was) said at 55: ""Many cases report the scrutiny by courts of statutory provisions designed to derogate from the open administration of justice. Running through these decisions is a common theme. It is that, by our tradition, the open administration of justice is the rule. Statutory derogation from openness is the exception. In the defence of the rule, such statutes will usually be strictly and narrowly construed. Unless the derogation is specifically provided for, courts are loathe to expand the field of secret justice ..."" Samuels JA, in the course of analysing whether the publication of the names in suit would defeat the ends of justice, said at 61: ""The inquiry must start with the proposition, central to our notions of forensic procedure, that the courts customarily conduct their business in public in order that the integrity, fairness and efficiency of the system, and its administrators, may be maintained by its exposure to public scrutiny."" 22 The applicant submitted that ASIC should disclose in open hearing what was the reasoning process to support the protection of the information sought by ASIC without disclosing what that information was. It submitted that it should, to the extent possible, identify the reasons why the information was being withheld without disclosing the information. The difficulty with acceding to that submission is that exposing the reasoning process would inevitably disclose the information sought to be protected. There were also a number of matters in respect of the claim for public interest immunity privilege raised in the confidential material which I wanted to discuss with counsel for ASIC but it was not possible to do this in open session without exposing the information that ASIC sought to protect. 23 The difficulty with which I was faced in this application by ASIC was that in order to determine whether orders should be made under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act I must have regard to the confidential affidavits (not served on the parties) filed by ASIC and its confidential submissions (not served on the parties) in order to understand the basis for the application. I reached the conclusion that in order to preserve the subject-matter of ASIC's claim for public interest immunity privilege I was compelled to make orders under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court Act in order to avoid prejudice to the administration of justice.

Case280,Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352,"Applying those principles, in my opinion the Work Trial Agreement in the form sent by Mr Mihelcic to Mr Sutczak on 30 December 1996, including cl 4 set out in [18] above, formed part of the contract which was in force at the time Mr Fowle suffered his injury. The Commonwealth and Comcare by their subsequent conduct, and in particular by meeting all Mr Fowle's wages notwithstanding that he was doing work for the Hydro, impliedly accepted the terms in the Work Trial Agreement. Pre-contractual conduct can cast light on the genesis of the contract and its objective aim: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347-352 , Brambles at [24]. Here the essence of the term appeared in the original Work Trial Agreement ([11] above), which had been prepared by the Commonwealth. Subsequently the Hydro, through Mr Sutczak, emphasised the importance of indemnity ([17] above). The potential for workplace injury, and liability there for, was an obvious matter of concern for a substantial industrial employer like the Hydro. 30 The ""liability"" in question, a potential liability which might arise at some time in the future, must be the liability of the host employer, the Hydro. ""Liability"" means any legal liability of the Hydro. Obviously ""any injury"" does not mean literally any injury suffered by Mr Fowle. An injury which he suffered at home and unconnected with his work would not involve any liability of the Hydro. 31 The expression ""liability for any injury"" cannot be limited, as the defendants argued, to exclude common law liability. The words are not qualified in any way. It would have been open to Comcare and/or APS, as the preparer of the document, to limit it to accord with their particular circumstances. It is not to the point that entitlement of a Commonwealth employee to sue the Commonwealth for damages at common law is limited in scope and amount by s 45 of the SRC Act. At all relevant times the potential liability of the Hydro included liability at common law for negligence. The Hydro enjoyed no statutory protection comparable to that in s 45 of the Commonwealth Act.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.133,0.788,-0.962,-0.31300000000000017

Case284,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal which are under challenge constitute a decision under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The substantive application before the Tribunal was an application for review of the delegate's decision under s 13 of the Act not to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the respondent. The right to bring the application for review is contained in s 52A of the Act. The orders of the Tribunal defer or adjourn consideration of the application for review. The orders do not amount to a final decision or determination. In accordance with well-established authority the orders therefore do not constitute a decision within s 44(1) of the AAT Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 3 ALD 161 per Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, at 178, 180; Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (' Bond ') per Mason CJ at 335; Geographical Indications Committee v The Honourable Justice O'Connor (2000) 64 ALD 325 at 332-333. In my opinion, there is no right of appeal from the Tribunal's orders under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. 30 I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal constitute a decision under s 5 of the ADJR Act. The meaning of 'decision' in s 5 of the ADJR Act was considered by Mason CJ in Bond . His Honour said that a reviewable decision under s 5 of the ADJR Act had a number of characteristics, including the fact that it must be a substantive determination. His Honour said (at 337-338): 'Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination. With the exception of s 3(2)(g), the instances of decision mentioned in s 3(2) are all substantive in character. Moreover, the provisions in sub-ss (1), (2), (3) and (5) of s 3 point to a substantive determination. In this context the reference in s 3(2)(g) to ""doing or refusing to do any other act or thing "" (emphasis added) should be read as referring to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power. I do not perceive in s 16(1)(b) or in par (e) of Sched 1 or par (a) of Sched 2 to the AD(JR) Act any contrary implication. These exclusions from the AD(JR) Act or from s 13 appear to have been introduced for more abundant caution and it would be unwise to take too much from them. If ""decision"" were to embrace procedural determinations, then there would be little scope for review of ""conduct"", a concept which appears to be essentially procedural in character. To take an example, the refusal by a decision-maker of an application for an adjournment in the course of an administrative hearing would not constitute a reviewable decision, being a procedural matter not resolving a substantive issue and lacking the quality of finality. Then it is the ""conduct"" of the hearing in refusing an adjournment that is the subject of review. To treat the refusal of the adjournment in this way is more consistent with the concept of ""conduct"" than with the notion of ""decision under an enactment"".' 31 The applicant submitted that the order deferring or adjourning the application for review was conduct for the purpose of making a decision. It seems to me that that is probably the case, but the question which then arises is whether any of the grounds in s 6 of the ADJR Act are relevant to the grounds upon which the applicant challenges the orders. A number of the grounds, although not all of them, relate to the proposed decision which in this case is the decision to be made on the application for review either to affirm the decision of the delegate or to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the applicant. If necessary, I will give the parties the opportunity to make further submissions with respect to this issue. 32 It may not be necessary for the parties to make further submissions because I have also reached the conclusion that this is an appropriate case for relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The respondent did not argue that relief under s 39B was not, in theory, available. He submitted that it was not available in this case because there was no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. For the reasons set out below I reject that submission and hold that the Tribunal erred in a manner going to its jurisdiction. The respondent submitted that the Court would rarely exercise its discretion to issue constitutional writs in relation to a decision by the Tribunal to defer or adjourn an application for review. I agree with that as a general statement, but I think that this is an appropriate case. The Tribunal has erred in concluding that it could exercise the power in s 14A of the Act and it has erred in its consideration of its general power to adjourn in light of the provisions of the Act and, in particular, s 13(11)(a). 33 As I have said, before me both parties submitted that the power to defer in s 14A(1) was a power available to the Tribunal. The section in the AAT Act which confers various powers and discretions of the primary decision-maker on the Tribunal is s 43. It seems appropriate to interpret s 43(1) broadly and proceed on the basis that for the purpose of the subsection the Tribunal would be exercising the power to defer 'for the purpose of reviewing [the] application'. The power to defer is a power available to the Tribunal. It is a power which is subject to a limitation and any exercise of the power by the Tribunal is subject to the same limitation. What is the meaning of the limitation? First, I think the twelve-month period commences from the time the decision to defer is taken. With respect, I reject the view of the Tribunal member that it commences when the offence which is the subject of the charge was allegedly committed. There is no warrant in the section for identifying that as the commencement point. Secondly, I think that it is only possible to defer for a maximum period of twelve months and it is not possible to defer for twelve months on the basis of one charge or set of charges and then later for a further period of up to twelve months on the basis of a second and later charge or set of charges. The terms of the section are such that a deferral or deferrals of consideration of the application for review for longer than twelve months is not permitted. In my opinion, the words of the section are such that if the power to defer is exercised, consideration of the application for review must at least commence within a period of twelve months thereafter. 34 The Tribunal's general power to adjourn is not excluded by the fact that the power to defer is a power available to the Tribunal. The Tribunal is not bound to exercise the power to defer in s 14A. In any event, there is a clear difference between a statutory power to defer an application for review and a power to adjourn an application for review and there may be many reasons for adjourning an application which are unrelated to the matters referred to in s 14(1)(b) of the Act. The Tribunal might adjourn because of the unavailability of a party or witness or for any of the reasons that routinely lead to adjournments of a proceeding before a court or tribunal. 35 However, the general power to adjourn is affected by the provisions of the Act. First, if an application is made to adjourn or defer an application for review on the ground that a charge is pending, it would be appropriate that the decision-maker proceed under s 14A rather than the general power to adjourn in s 40(1). Secondly, and in any event, I doubt that there would be grounds to adjourn because of a pending charge. I say that because the alternative to the granting of an adjournment would not be that the applicant for review would be required to compromise his or her right to silence before the hearing of the criminal charge. The effect of s 13(11)(a) of the Act is quite clear. The decision-maker must not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to a person while proceedings for a relevant offence are pending in relation to that person. It is not clear what the Tribunal member meant when he said that s 13(11)(a) operated as a prohibition on the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal on review. Certainly the Tribunal could not grant a certificate of Australian citizenship, but it could list the matter for hearing and find that the facts fall within s 13(11)(a) and that it cannot or should not exercise the power in s 14A and, having reached those conclusions, dismiss the application for review and affirm the decision of the delegate. I turn now to apply these principles to the facts of this case. 36 The Tribunal member erred in concluding that the power in s 14A could, in the circumstances, be exercised by him. It is not entirely clear from the direction (see [12] above) what power the Tribunal member considered he was exercising on 8 September 2004 when he directed that the matter not be listed for hearing until after the resolution of the criminal charges. I think it is appropriate to view it as an exercise of the power to defer in s 14A because, for the reasons I have given, it would not have been a proper exercise of the discretion to adjourn the application on the ground referred to in the direction. What that means is that the power in s 14A was spent because consideration of the application did not at least commence within twelve months of 8 September 2004. 37 The exercise by the Tribunal of its general power to adjourn miscarried because it was not entitled to take into account the pending charge in considering whether to adjourn and, in any event, the Tribunal member misunderstood what would occur if the application was not adjourned. If not adjourned, then the application should have been listed and if the facts fell within s 13(11)(a) it should have been dismissed and the delegate's decision affirmed. 38 The applicant is entitled to relief, but I will give the parties leave to make further submissions as to the appropriate relief in light of these reasons.

Case287,Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63,"PCR has submitted that it is not the true 'aggressor' in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63 (' Amalgamated Mining '). In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman's solicitors alleging that Warman's copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining's supplier were unjustified. In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs, Wilcox J said (at 67-8): 'If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ [in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors [1923] 2 KB 166] of asking who, in the litigation, was the attacker and who was the defender, I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from [Warman's solicitors] . Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining, it is that company which has an interest in defending and, in a commercial sense, probably has very little alternative other than to take that course. I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say, therefore, that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is, in substance, the defender.' His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175. 31 I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan . Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant. In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR. PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence. Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station, PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate. It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived, or threatened to deprive, PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself. Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as ' the party attacked ' in these proceedings, or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker. 32 PCR also submits that GCB is joined only as an interested party, and not as an 'adversary' to PCR. PCR refers to the fact that no relief is sought against GCB specifically, and says that GCB was only joined in the present proceedings because Wilcox J had required its joinder in the previous litigation. PCR also refers to the fact that, despite the fact that PCR was successful before Wilcox J, GCB was not required to pay PCR's costs, which it submits recognised GCB's non-adversarial status in the proceedings. The submission is that GCB, although joined, has no real need to participate in these proceedings because no relief is claimed against it.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.082,0.848,-0.8855,-0.08924999999999983
Case288,Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.'",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.071,0.076,0.854,-0.5591,1.0511499999999994
Case289,Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1,"In an often-cited passage of the Full Federal Court, Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ in Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 said at 4: 'In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the appellant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means. It is not for the party seeking security to raise the matter; it is an essential part of the case of a company seeking to resist an order for security on the ground that the granting of security will frustrate the litigation to raise the issue of the impecuniosity of those whom the litigation will benefit and to prove the necessary facts.' 23 The fact that PCR has chosen to oppose the application without providing adequate evidence of its financial position poses a difficulty for the Court. However, given the evidence that PCR is a not-for-profit organisation managed by volunteers, I think it is reasonable to infer that those supporters will not benefit from the litigation in any pecuniary sense, especially since these proceedings seek administrative law remedies rather than damages.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.128,0.108,0.764,0.807,5.804499999999999

In summary, those considerations are: 1) the chances of success of the applicant and whether the claim is bona fide; 2) the risk that the applicant could not satisfy a costs order; 3) whether the application for security for costs has been promptly brought; 4) whether the application for security for costs is being used oppressively to deny an impecunious litigant access to the court; 5) whether the applicant's impecuniosity arises out of the act in respect of which relief is sought; 6) whether there are third parties standing behind the applicant who are likely to benefit from the litigation and if so, whether they have proffered security for the costs of the litigation; 7) whether an order for security for costs would frustrate the litigation; 8) whether there are any public interest considerations to be taken into account; 9) any matters relevant to the discretion which are distinctive to the circumstances of the case. 16 I am unable at this early stage of proceedings to form a conclusion concerning the merits of the application. As Tamberlin J said in Chapman v Luminis at [17]: 'It is neither possible nor appropriate on a security for costs application to reach any firm conclusions as to the prospects of an appeal being successful beyond a general consideration of the reasons for decision and the formation of a general overview.' 17 Although the appeal is from a decision by ACMA rather than from a decision of this Court, I consider Tamberlin J's observations are pertinent. The notice of appeal in these proceedings makes numerous challenges to the decision-making process engaged in by ACMA, and I am not able to assess the merits of those challenges without investigating factual material. The fact that the appellant's challenge relates to the second decision of ACMA does not give rise to the inference that the appeal will not succeed. 18 PCR has not provided any direct evidence to the Court with respect to its incorporation, office-bearers, or financial position, although in its oral submissions it made brief reference to the fact that it was impecunious. The only evidence relating to the current financial status of PCR is the statement contained in the affidavit of Mr Norbert Lindberg, secretary of PCR, that the delay by PCR in bringing proceedings has resulted, in part, from the need to raise funds to finance the litigation. The Court has no information with respect to the success of PCR's fundraising activities and no recent financial statements have been produced. The Court has been provided with financial statements from 2003-2004 but because PCR was still operating the radio station and was in receipt of community grants at this time, the statements provide very little guidance as to the current finances of PCR. Since early 2004 PCR, because of the loss of its broadcasting licence, has not been eligible for the community grants which has presumably had an adverse effect on its financial position.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.082,0.04,0.878,0.9489,6.27915

Case302,The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.' 27 I consider that the circumstances of the present case are, despite some similarities, also distinguishable from those considered by Branson J in Airtourer . That case involved an impecunious co-operative which was pursuing litigation out of a limited pool of funds. There was evidence before her Honour that the applicant planned to exhaust its funds to meet its own legal costs, leaving no funds in reserve for any costs order made against it. Branson J commented at [27]: 'I do not conclude that an order requiring the applicant to provide a relatively modest sum by way of security for costs would preclude the applicant from pursuing its application to the Court. It might require the directors of the applicant to request additional funds from members of the applicant but, as the proceeding is presumably being pursued by the applicant in the interests of its members, I see nothing inappropriate in such an outcome.' 28 Since PCR is a not-for-profit organisation which aims to provide radio broadcasts serving youth and ethnic minority groups, the proceedings are not being pursued by PCR in the interests of its 'members' so much as in the interests of the wider community group which it serves. I am not satisfied that volunteer members of a not-for-profit organisation should be required to provide funds for litigation when the organisation is impecunious. To impose such a requirement would mean a not-for-profit community organisation with a history of providing services to the public, which was legitimately bringing proceedings to the Court, might be prevented from pursuing an action to protect its interests merely on the ground of impecuniosity. This would, in my opinion, breach the principle that impecuniosity should not, without more, prevent a litigant from accessing the courts. 29 However, the difficulty which remains in this instance is that, because PCR has provided very limited information with respect to its financial status, members, objectives, any possible sources of funding and other relevant details, no conclusive finding can be made on the evidence as to the effect which an order for security for costs may have in these proceedings. Further, in the absence of a direct submission from PCR that the proceedings would be stifled if an order were made, I am unwilling to draw the inference that this consequence would follow.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.062,0.059,0.88,0.0719,3.2516500000000006
Case303,Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 673,"A further consideration is that PCR is not a mere nominal applicant.

Hely J observed in that case at [37]: 'In my view, the fact that no private right or special interest of the applicant is involved in these proceedings is a factor which weighs in favour of making an order for security, rather than against it.' 25 His Honour added at [38]: 'If those who control the applicant wish to have the benefit of litigating when no private right or special interest of the applicant is at stake in the proceedings and when the applicant is impecunious, then it is appropriate that security for the respondent's costs be provided.'",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.193,0.038,0.77,0.9781,6.27135
Case304,Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175,"PCR has submitted that it is not the true 'aggressor' in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63 (' Amalgamated Mining '). In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman's solicitors alleging that Warman's copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining's supplier were unjustified. In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs, Wilcox J said (at 67-8): 'If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ [in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors [1923] 2 KB 166] of asking who, in the litigation, was the attacker and who was the defender, I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from [Warman's solicitors] . Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining, it is that company which has an interest in defending and, in a commercial sense, probably has very little alternative other than to take that course. I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say, therefore, that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is, in substance, the defender.' His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175. 31 I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan . Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant. In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR. PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence. Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station, PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate. It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived, or threatened to deprive, PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself. Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as ' the party attacked ' in these proceedings, or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.062,0.085,0.853,-0.924,-0.21099999999999985

In this one can discern that in several respects he was contending that the Tribunal fell into an error of law which caused it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question, and to ignore relevant material, so exceeding its authority or powers: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179. The essence of his complaints are both that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct sections of the Act (eg s 615), and misconstrued or misapplied the terms of the Act (eg ""to be negotiated"" or ""reasonable excuse""). To this extent, as I will indicate, I am satisfied that Mr Kronen's application to this Court has in some degree enlivened its jurisdiction under the AAT Act. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success and for the reason that in ascribing error to the Tribunal he misapprehends the scheme of the Act and of the decision-making processes it mandates.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.057,0.122,0.821,-0.9511,-0.2638499999999997
Case309,Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280,"to this trio is Mr Kronen's conception of what is signified by the words ""to be negotiated"" in s 605(3). What is clear is that the level of permissible compromise and of required mutual agreement that this formula might otherwise suggest when used in other contexts, is radically curtailed in this statutory setting. Whether one can say that the ordinary meaning of ""negotiate"" is what is intended here (albeit what can be negotiated is limited by the Act and its purposes), hence the meaning is a question of fact: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287 (proposition 2); or that its meaning and hence proper construction is contrived by its legislative settings, hence are questions of law: Pozzolanic , 287 (propositions 1 and 4), what is clear is that Mr Kronen misapprehends the latitude the Act gives him. Elblematic of this was his presenting Maxima with negotiation procedures which included referral to an independent panel if any terms could not be agreed. If Mr Kronen is to qualify for a newstart allowance, he was required, in the circumstances, enter into an activity agreement: s 593(1)(e); he was required to undertake one or more activities that the Secretary regarded as suitable for the person: s 606(1); the terms of the agreement were to be approved by the Secretary. In this scheme, the ""right to negotiate"" could be illusory in quite some degree for some purposes and especially when the Secretary (or a delegate) takes decisions or actions in effectuation of the purposes of the Act itself. This is not to say that there was no room for discussion, accommodation and compromise. Rather, it is to recognise that the actual terms of the negotiation itself were something in relation to which the Secretary, acting reasonably and in good faith, could ultimately dictate, approve or disapprove, if there was to be an agreement. The Tribunal clearly understood this was the case: see Reasons [106]-[108]. It committed no error of law in construing and hence giving legal effect to the ""negotiation expectation"" of s 605(3) as it did. Further, the Tribunal satisfied itself on the evidence before it that the requirements Maxima sought to impose were reasonable and that those upon which Mr Kronen insisted were unreasonable in the circumstances. These fact findings were open to it and were unimpeachable in this proceeding.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.095,0.019,0.886,0.9836,6.3666
Case310,Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232,"There is one case concerning par (ac). It is Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232. That was an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was therefore limited to questions of law. The decision appears to have been based upon a finding that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had considered irrelevant material in construing the relevant legislative provisions. In those circumstances, the decision can be of little assistance for present purposes. 35 This case depends upon the meaning of the expression ""in rail transport"". A considerable amount of time was spent in discussing the meaning of the word ""in"", in my opinion, not a particularly fruitful area of debate. To my mind, the more significant aspect is the word ""transport"", with any particular connotations that the word ""rail"" may contribute. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word ""transport"", used as a noun, to mean: 'transfer or conveyance of property ... the carrying or conveyance of a person or thing from one place to another ... a system or means of transportation or conveyance of people, goods etc ...' 36 The question depends substantially upon whether, in the present context, the word ""transport"" means the carriage or conveyance of persons or things or the system of transportation or conveyance. The Commissioner advanced the former view. Queensland Rail advanced the latter. The Commissioner submitted that the word ""in"" connoted such a close association between the use of the diesel fuel and the rail that it could only be satisfied if the usage occurred on the rail. Thus the movement of persons or goods (including Queensland Rail's own equipment) on rail would be included, but loading or unloading a train with loading equipment, which was not on-rail, would not. Similarly, the use of diesel fuel in rail-mounted track maintenance equipment would be included, but such use in non-rail mounted equipment would not. 37 This approach may give too much significance to the word ""rail"" which is used adjectivally to qualify the word ""transport"". The preposition ""in"" governs the noun ""transport"". In other words the phrase ""in rail transport"" means ""in transport which uses rail"". 38 If Parliament had intended that only use of diesel fuel in activities on-rail was to attract the rebate, it would have been easy to say so. Language analogous to the very specific language used for the purpose of excluding the rebate in the case of vehicles used on public roads and use relating to forestry might have been appropriate. Paragraphs (ad), (b), (c) and (d) are ""place-specific"" and might also have been appropriate models for a requirement that the relevant activity occur ""on-rail"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.036,0.003,0.961,0.9144,6.167400000000001
Case311,White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298,"Lindgren J has recently collected the cases on the meaning and effect of s 31A and comparable provisions: White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58] - [59] , where he considered the test to be whether there are ""real"" as opposed to ""fanciful"" or ""merely arguable"" prospects. 10 Lilly's motion gives rise to three issues. The first is the viability of the applicant's claim to relief under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . The second is whether the applicant has standing to claim relief under the ADJR Act, s 192 of the Patents Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act . The third is whether, assuming it has standing, it should be denied relief because of its delay. In a s 31A context, in each case the question is whether the Court is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the relevant claim or issue. 11 The applicant alleges that in applying for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly represented to the first respondent (the Commissioner) that the pharmaceutical substance on the ARTG on which it relied was disclosed in claims 1 to 4 and 6 of the Patent.

Case312,Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75,"In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent. At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said: The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce. They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand. Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO .... Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts .... The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation. No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense. However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business .... 14 The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different. That is true, but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here. Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at 604, upon which Glueck was based, in which it was said: What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it ... has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.

Case316,Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105,"In Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105 at [19] the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193 ( Ritz ), and said: [Adapting] that language to the design context, the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged and thus would include any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being 'appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense' by the entry not being expunged. 27 I return to the Assa Abloy test recorded at [18]. Adapted to the present case, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the applicant would be disadvantaged in the sense that it would be prevented from exploiting the invention in any of the respects falling within the definition of ""exploit"" in the Patents Act . That includes a number of things preparatory to placing a product in the marketplace. Matters falling within the concept of ""launching"" a product include importing, keeping for the purpose of offering for sale, and using. In my view the fair reading of par 49 of Mr Gray's affidavit is that propounded by the applicant. Nor do I think the use of the word ""marketing"" in par 26 of that affidavit bears the emphasis Lilly places on it. All Mr Gray is saying is that in order successfully to sell a product, that is to say make money out of it, PBS listing is essential. As appears from [19] and [21], the applicant has pleaded only that it has not yet obtained TGA approval, believes it will obtain it in late 2008 or early 2009, and will not import and sell the product until it receives TGA registration. It does not plead PBS listing as a precondition. The Assa Abloy test speaks of the existence of a reasonable possibility of disadvantage. For the purposes of a s 31A application, I am not satisfied that that possibility does not exist. I am not persuaded that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the ADJR, s 192 and s 39A parts of the proceeding by reason of a lack of standing. 28 Section 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act provides that an application for an order of review in relation to a written decision ""that was furnished to the applicant"" must be lodged within the prescribed period or within such further time as the court allows. Under sub-s (3) the prescribed period is the period commencing on the day on which the decision is made and ending on the 28 th day after the decision is ""furnished to the applicant"". Subsection (4) provides that where no period is prescribed, the court may refuse to entertain an application if of the opinion that the application was not made within a reasonable time after the decision was made. In forming an opinion for the purposes of subs (4), the court is to have regard to the time at which the applicant became aware of the making of the decision: subs (5)(a).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.05,0.898,0.2453,3.8565500000000004

In this case the applicant discovered the existence of the decision through its own resources. I agree with Pincus J in Australian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone (1988) 20 FCR 377 that the expression ""furnished to the applicant"" contemplates delivery specifically to the applicant by the decision-maker. Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss (4) and (5). 30 It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s 192 and s 39B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect, so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time. 31 A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties' contentions on delay. 14 January 2000 Extension of term granted 12 March 2002 Applicant incorporated May 2003 Applicant signed agreement with EBEWE Pharma Late May 2005, 2006- 2007 Dr Schnait of EBEWE Pharma tells Mr Gray that while Lilly had an Austrian patent for the product he could find no equivalent patent in Australia 2 August 2007 Applicant becomes aware of Australian patent and extension of term 12 October 2007 Applicant obtains patent file from IP Australia 26 October 2007 Applicant's TGA application 5 December 2007 Applicant writes to Lilly contending that extension of term was wrong and seeking confirmation of this 18 December 2007 Lilly sends letter of demand as to infringement 20 December 2007 Applicant seeks without prejudice meeting with Lilly to discuss commercial resolution 11 January to 27 February 2008 Communications about without prejudice meeting 28 February 2008 Without prejudice meeting 6 March 2008 Negotiations break down; Lilly sends second letter of demand 18 March 2008 Applicant informed of Austrian injunction 19 March 2008 Applicant seeks review of extension",Criminal Case,Rape,0.073,0.059,0.868,0.7081,5.46435

Those principles, so far as presently relevant, may be summarised as follows. First, the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceeding by making a costs order. Secondly, although the Court will not ordinarily seek to determine the likely outcome of a hypothetical trial, it may be more ready to do so where the issues are simple and issues of credit do not arise.

Case320,Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264,"The Bankruptcy Act recognises that the Court may extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where proceedings to set aside the judgment in respect of which the notice was issued have been instituted by the debtor (s 41(6A)(a)). The power to extend time for compliance is in aid of the power to set aside the notice itself should the judgment ultimately be set aside ( Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264 at 268). The judgment upon which the bankruptcy notice was founded has now been set aside. I conclude that Mr George Elias acted reasonably in instituting this proceeding. 15 The trustee was entitled to serve the bankruptcy notice as no stay of execution of the District Court judgment had been sought (s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act ). I am not satisfied that he acted unreasonably in doing so. However, he must be assumed to have understood that, if the judgment were set aside on appeal, the judgment debt on which the bankruptcy notice was founded would no longer exist and the notice would be liable to be set aside. 16 The judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgment of the District Court was unanimous. One member of the Court of Appeal was implicitly critical of the conduct of the trustee in opposing a stay of proceedings in the District Court to allow the s 139ZQ notice to be challenged in the Federal Magistrates Court (Giles JA at [51]). Another member of the Court of Appeal considered that there was 'some plausibility' in the contention that the District Court proceeding should have been stayed but found it unnecessary to consider the issue (Santow JA at [111]). The third member (Bryson JA) of the Court of Appeal also found it unnecessary to consider the issue. However, all members of the Court of Appeal concluded that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment against Mr George Elias. I infer that the District Court adopted this course at the invitation of the trustee.

In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 , Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ referred to the discretionary power to grant a declaration as being confined by considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power.

It is a discretionary power which '[i]t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter ... by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise.' However, it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. Hence, declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions.

In Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365 ("" Cell Tech Communications ""), Lindgren J made a number of observations about the scope of O 9 r 7(1). His Honour said that the rule was to be distinguished from an application for summary dismissal (O 20 r 2) and an application for the striking out of pleading (O 11 r 16). To these I would add an application for summary judgment (Federal Court Act s 31A) and an order for dismissal which may follow the determination of a separate question under O 29 r 2. Lindgren J also made the point (at 370) that, although the other procedures he identified were to be distinguished from O 9 r 7, that was not to say that ""considerations relevant to such applications may not be relevant to an application under one or other of the paragraphs of O 9, r 7(1)"". The authorities establish that O 9 r 7(1) is not confined to cases where there has been service outside the jurisdiction. While O 9 r 7(1)(b), (c) and (d) refer to service of an originating process, (a) does not, and under that subparagraph an originating process may be set aside where the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim made in it, or where the originating process constitutes an abuse of process: F Sharkey &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Fisher [1980] FCA 146 ; (1980) 50 FLR 130 ; 33 ALR 173 ; Cell Tech Communications (at 370). The second respondent's first ground (see [7] above) raises an issue of jurisdiction and, if made good, engages the power to set aside the originating process. By contrast, the second ground does not raise an issue of jurisdiction, and, even if made good, does not engage the power to set aside the originating process. I have not been able to find any direct authority addressing the submission by the second respondent that an originating process served within the jurisdiction may nevertheless be set aside because the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. There is authority that it is not appropriate to exercise the power in O 9 r 7 on the ground that a party's pleadings are defective: Cell Tech Communications at 371 per Lindgren J. I do not think the power in O 9 r 7 extends to cases where the originating process has been served within the jurisdiction and a respondent claims that the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. The rules, and now s 31A of the Federal Court Act, provide adequate procedures for a party who claims that the case against him or her has no substance. The second respondent's submission that I can order that the application be set aside under O 9 r 7 because the applicant does not have a prima facie case on the merits must be rejected. I would not permit the second respondent to call in aid s 31A of the Federal Court Act in circumstances where it was not referred to in the application or supporting affidavit and was only mentioned briefly in submissions.

One of the leading High Court decisions in the area of declarations is Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421.

His Honour said that, in general, the requirements identified by Lord Dunedin in Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 should be satisfied before the discretion to make a declaration is exercised. In the latter case, Lord Dunedin said (at 448): ""The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.103,0.009,0.888,0.9639,6.27965

In my opinion, there is a matter in this case and it arises under a law of the Parliament, namely, the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). There is a real controversy and the question raised is not an abstract or hypothetical question. It seems to me important not to confuse considerations relating to the desirability of the Tribunal ruling on the issue and then the matter proceeding by way of judicial review through the seeking of constitutional writs.

Basically, the question in every case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment."" Brennan J said (at 333-334; 209): ""A controversy as to the lawfulness of future conduct cannot be said to be immediate and real if it is unlikely that the applicant will engage in the conduct ( Golden, Acting District Attorney of Kings County v. Zwickler [1969] USSC 46 ; (1969) 394 U.S. 103 , at p. 109).

An affidavit was sworn in support of the motion, and that affidavit sets out the grounds upon which the application is made. They are as follows: There is no justiciable controversy or ""matter"" arising under a law made by the Parliament and therefore paragraph 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act is not a proper source of jurisdiction and the declaratory relief sought under s 21 of the Federal Court Act is not available. The relief sought should be refused in any event because an adequate alternative remedy is available, being a review by the first respondent, the Migration Review Tribunal, and, if appropriate, an application for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal. In this case, the facts necessary for determining whether a declaration should be made have occurred and are not in dispute. The second respondent claims that the applicant was given notice of the delegate's decision and the reasons therefor on 22 September 2008, and that by reason of s 494C of the Act (and the construction placed on that section in Xie ) the applicant's application for review by the Tribunal is not competent.

The applicant complained that the SCT should not have taken into account the video surveillance evidence because it was in digital format. He said that the video might have been altered, cropped, edited or corrupted in its conversion to the digital format. He also complained that the SCT failed to take into consideration that the medical report from Dr BC was based on a short term medical treatment. It failed to take into account that Dr BC was a general practitioner, not a specialist. It failed to take into account any and all pain levels experienced in the activities seen on the video footage. He said that the SCT could not know what medication he had taken on that day or prior to being able to drive his vehicle. The SCT failed to take into account the disadvantage that he had been placed in by receiving his disability support pension. He said also that the SCT should not have taken into account the report of the private investigators.

It is sufficient for the respondent to demonstrate that there is a reason or it is an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the discretion: see Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66. 6 The prima facie assumption is that the judgment appealed from is correct and the Court should not deprive a litigant of the benefit of a judgment in its favour. Counsel for the Union relied on this and opposed the grant of a stay upon the basis, first, that the appeal disclosed no arguable ground of appeal, alternatively, the prospects of success were weak; secondly, Ms Chester said all but three of the employees had indicated that they would repay the money if called upon to do so pursuant to a judgment of the Court on appeal; and, thirdly, the evidence for Prestige did not rise above speculation as to the difficulty of recovery. 7 According to counsel for Prestige, it proposed to challenge the judgment under appeal on two bases, first, that as a matter of construction the Victorian Arts Centre is not a premise of a state government instrumentality for the purposes of the relevant industrial awards in the ordinary sense of those words; and, secondly, as understood in context, having regard to relevant history, it was not such an instrumentality.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.019,0.903,0.8778,6.0153

Case364,SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163,"This is set out conveniently in [3] to [17] of the decision of the Federal Magistrate whose orders are the subject of the present appeal: SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 163. The following is an adaptation of those paragraphs. I should indicate at the outset that the Tribunal has made three decisions in relation to review applications of the appellant. Though it is technically inaccurate, I will for ease in exposition differentiate between what I will call the ""first Tribunal"", ""the second Tribunal"" and the ""third Tribunal"". 4 The Tribunal decision, the subject of the present judicial review proceedings, is in fact the third decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appellant. The first review was conducted in 2000. The appellant was unsuccessful, both before the delegate of the Minister and before the Tribunal at that time and for reasons of lack of credibility in each instance. In the claim advanced by the appellant in 2000 he and his wife used false identities. His claimed entitlement to a protection visa and to refugee status under the Refugee Convention arose from a fear of his being persecuted by Serbs, arising out of what he said was his forced conscription into the Kosovo Liberation Army. 5 Notwithstanding the lack of success of their application, in 2001 the Minister exercised his discretion under s 417(1) of the Act and provided the appellant and his wife with three year protection visas on humanitarian grounds.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.032,0.06,0.908,-0.7506,0.4009000000000005
Case365,STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556,"The Tribunal noted that the appellant's brother had succeeded on a similar claim. The appellant's brother's claim had been made prior to the amendment of s 91S of the Act that was effected by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 6) 2001 (Cth) . The effect of these amendments is described in the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556. 14 The Tribunal went on to say: Even if I were satisfied which I am not that the applicant's family were involved in such a feud, the applicant's claims amount to a claim to fear persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group, namely his family. In considering such a claim, s 91S of the Migration Act would be relevant and, in interpreting that provision, I would be bound by the terms and reasons of the High Court's decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ... Following that decision and applying s 91S(a) , it is clear that the applicant's cousin, Martin's fear of persecution would be for a reason other than those mentioned in Art 1A(2) of the Convention namely revenge for murder. Section 91S(a) would then require that fear of persecution to be disregarded. Section 91S(b)(i) would then require the applicant's fear of persecution to be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that that fear would not exist if his cousin's fear had never existed. And s 91S(b)(ii) would require that his father's and brother's fear of persecution be disregarded, since it would be reasonable to conclude that neither of those fears would exist either if the cousin's fear had never existed. The result of disregarding the fears of persecution of the cousin, the applicant, the father and the brother would then be that the applicant would be treated as not having a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the (sic) his family. 15 It is necessary to refer only to two provisions of the Act, s 91S and s 425. Section 91S provides: For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person (the first person), in determining whether the first person has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the first person's family: (a) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear or persecution is not a reason mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; and (b) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that: (i) the first person has ever experienced; or (ii) any other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of the family has ever experienced; where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution would not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution mentioned in paragraph (a) had never existed. 16 As the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs illustrates, this provision has an inexorable operation to fears of persecution based on family membership in the usual blood feud case. 17 Section 425(1) provides: The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.026,0.138,0.836,-0.9973,-0.3785499999999997
Case366,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152,"As the High Court indicated in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [33] to [35]: [33] The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review "". The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important. [34] Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa. The statutory language ""arising in relation to the decision under review"" is more particular. The issues arising in relation to a decision under review are to be identified having regard not only to the fact that the Tribunal may exercise ... all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the original decision-maker (here, the minister's delegate), but also to the fact that the Tribunal is to review that particular decision, for which the decision-maker will have given reasons. [35] The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered. The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. But ... unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal (as they may be), it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the Tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant. (Emphasis in original.) 19 As I have already noted, the particular decision that was under review by the third Tribunal was the decision of the second delegate who said that he found the appellant was not credible in those claims originally advanced under his false identity and that he made no claims in relation to fear of persecution in Albania under his actual name. To reiterate the Albanian blood feud claims were only raised for the first time before the second Tribunal whose decision was quashed by Brown FM. 20 There has been recent discussion and some level of disagreement between judges of this Court on the operation of s 425(1) where a Tribunal decision is quashed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal (whether or not constituted by the same member) for determination.

Case367,SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291,"(i) Until the Tribunal makes a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s 414, it has a duty to perform that particular review: SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291 at [39]. 23 (iii) When a decision on a particular review is set aside, it is a decision of the Tribunal, not of the person constituting it, that is set aside: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 at [31] .

Case376,Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314,"Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314 ( Arthur Murray ) was, in a sense, the converse of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The taxpayer company received fees for dancing lessons yet to be given. It placed the fees in a suspense account until the lessons were given, when it transferred them to its revenue account. The High Court held that the fees were not assessable income at the time of receipt. 146 In Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 434, Hill J, with whom Jenkinson and Einfeld JJ agreed, cautioned against a too ready reliance on business and accounting practice relating to preparation of the company's profit and loss account required in accordance with s 269(1) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 443 446). His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question. But his affidavit and subsequent explanation makes it clear that he has answered that question by reference to the companies law for the purposes of which the relevant standards have been prepared and with which of course each of the respondents was obliged to comply. Mr Westworth's affidavit [regarding accounting practices] makes clear that he too has addressed himself to that issue, not relevant in the present proceedings. All that may be said is that if there be no impediment in the Act to bringing into account, in a case such as the present, a net profit figure as gross income, then that profit figure will need to be calculated in accordance with the accounting standards. The real issue for decision is rather a question of construction of the Act, namely, whether in a case such as the present, the scheme of the Act precludes treating as gross income the net profit calculated in accordance with the financial or actuarial method. Hill J noted earlier, however, that accounting evidence was often relevant and often highly significant in resolving issues under the Act. He gave as an example the issue whether a cash receipts or accruals basis of accounting will give ""a true reflex of the income derived by a taxpayer"" (at 443, citing Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 his Honour also cited Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314). 149 In Commissioner of Taxation (Commonwealth) v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Limited (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488, the High Court in a joint judgment, drew attention to the fact that the meaning of the word ""derived"" in a particular provision could not be ascertained without at least some reference to the thing said to be derived (in that case, the profits of the company) (at [42]). In particular their Honours cautioned against conflating the concept of derivation of income with derivation of profits. Their Honours referred to the fact that for the most part the notion of ""income"" directs attention to ""receipts"" by a taxpayer. Their Honours further referred to the late Professor RW Parsons's work, Income Taxation in Australia (The Law Book Company, 1985) in which the learned author stated (at [2.10]): ""For the most part, the law expresses an ordinary usage notion of derivation of a receipt"". I do not think that their Honours or the late learned author were intending to exclude the possibility that business and accounting practice might demonstrate, in the case of the particular category of income, that it is derived at a time other than upon receipt. Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314 stands against the existence of any such universal rule.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.117,0.025,0.859,0.9977,6.402950000000001

As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer. 69 The Commissioner distinguishes Bowaters 38 TC 593 on the basis that Harman J noted (at 597) that ""[t]here is no evidence here that the function of this Company was mainly the holding of investments"". The Commissioner suggests that his Lordship was intending to distinguish holding companies from purely passive investment companies. The evidence 70 The Commissioner relies on two forms of evidence as being relevant to the question whether ABB Zurich derived income consisting of the dividend when the dividend was declared. The first is evidence relating to the international group of companies known as the ABB Group and its accounting practices. This evidence is found in an affidavit of Alfred Storck of the ABB Group and documentary exhibits. The second class of evidence is expert evidence of an accountant, Brigid Therese Curran, adduced by the Commissioner. The Commissioner read Ms Curran's affidavit subject to objection by the applicants on the ground of relevance. 71 Mr Storck is the Deputy Chief Financial Officer and the person responsible for Corporate Finance and Taxes for the ABB Group. In 1996, he was employed by ABB Zurich as head of its Taxation Division. Mr Storck states that ABB Group ""specialises in the engineering of power and automation technologies"" and ""supplies products and services to utility and industrial customers around the world"". 119 The last of the cases principally relied on by the applicants, Bowaters 38 TC 593, concerned a dividend declared by an Australian subsidiary of a United Kingdom parent. The case concerned provisions of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and the Finance Act 1952 (UK). The dividend in question was declared on 16 December 1953 but not paid until 28 January 1954. The relevant accounting period commenced on 1 October 1953 and ended on 31 December 1953. Accordingly, the dividend was declared during that chargeable accounting period, but paid after it. 120 The taxpayer company was the main selling company of the Bowaters organisation and was the principal member of a group of companies. It had two subsidiaries that were ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and a number of non-resident subsidiaries, including the Australian company that declared the dividend. At the annual general meeting of the Australian company held on 16 December 1953, the dividend was declared, in respect of its accounting year ended 30 September 1953, payable forthwith. Bowaters' accounts for the year ended 30 September 1953 anticipated the dividend to be declared by the Australian company. 121 The particular dividend was not included in Bowaters' computation of its profits for the purposes of Excess Profits Levy for the period of three months to 31 December 1953, on the ground that it was received after 31 December 1953. However, the Crown included it in the assessment of profits to Excess Profits Levy for that three month period on the ground that the income arose during that period. It was against that assessment that Bowaters appealed. The Crown affirmed the assessment. As required by Bowaters, a case was stated for the opinion of the High Court. 124 Harman J noted that there was no evidence that the functions of Bowaters was mainly the holding of investments. Rather its business was mainly that of trading in paper, although it also had a number of wholly owned subsidiaries from which it might draw dividends. Accordingly, s 19(4) had no application. 125 His Lordship considered that various English authorities to which he referred established that ""excepting the case of receipts from trade or receipts analogous to trading receipts, the [fundamental conception of Income Tax legislation] is ... receipt and not receivability"" (at 599). His Lordship rejected the Crown's submission that the dividends were as much a part of Bowaters' trade as were the profits of its trading activities. 126 It followed that the expression ""income arising"" in the context before his Lordship (a dividend declared and paid by an Australian subsidiary to its United Kingdom parent) and in every context except that of trade debts, meant income received. The company's appeal was allowed. 127 Harman J expressed the opinion (at 599) that the method by which Bowaters kept its accounts had no relevance for tax purposes. 128 Bowaters 38 TC 593 is said to be against the Commissioner's contention in the present case. I note that I do not see any relevant distinction between the concepts ""arising"" in ss 19 and 20(1) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and ""derived"" in the Australian s 128B(1): see Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; 23 CLR 119 at 133 noted at [106] above. 129 Unlike Bowaters, ABB Zurich would apparently have qualified for the purposes of s 19(4) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) as a company whose functions consisted wholly or mainly in the ""holding of investments"". Indeed, the only business of ABB Zurich was that of managing the affairs of its some 1,000 subsidiaries. It appears, although not clearly so, that the reason why Harman J did not accept a submission by the Crown that the receipt of dividends was as much a part of Bowaters' trade as was the profit from its trading activity, was that s 19(4) did not apply (at 599). In other words, if s 19(4) had applied, as it apparently would have done to the circumstances of ABB Zurich, his Lordship would have treated a dividend from its subsidiary in the same way as he would have done a trading receipt. It seems that his Lordship would have treated the dividend as derived when the debt for it arose, that is to say, when the subsidiary declared the dividend (at 598). 130 Before returning to consider the evidence, in particular that of Ms Curran, I will refer to the authorities called in aid of the Commissioner.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.043,0.022,0.935,0.969,6.3705

Case380,Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441,"Prior to the introduction of those provisions, there was a well established distinction between final and interim dividends. A declaration of a final dividend by the shareholders gave rise to an immediate debt owed by the company to the shareholders, whereas a resolution by the directors to pay an interim dividend did not do so: Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504 at 511 512; Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 572; Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 616 at 625; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 at 455. Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment. A decision of the directors to pay an interim dividend, on the other hand, could always be revoked down to the time fixed for payment. 66 The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J. 139 The Commissioner also refers to a passage in the judgment of Aickin J in Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441. His Honour stated (at 469) that in the case of a company that had no activity other than the receipt of dividends from shares that it had purchased, it would ordinarily be regarded as carrying on a business, even if it did not actively manage its portfolio of investments, whereas an individual in the same circumstances would not necessarily be regarded as carrying on such a business. Aickin J cited Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 at 212 per Barwick CJ and 221 per Menzies J. Again, the statement is relevant only to the question whether ABB Zurich carried on a business. I accept that it did. 140 Finally, the Commissioner relies on BHP v FCT 99 ATC 5193, in which Kenny J said (at [48]) that the taxpayer company carried on businesses which included holding shares in, and managing, its subsidiaries. Her Honour stated, citing Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 and Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441, that the holding of shares in subsidiaries can of itself constitute the carrying of a business for the purposes of s 51(1) of the Act. 167 Cases on the statutory definition of ""paid"" similarly suggest that the word ""paid"", even standing alone, refers to the making over of a benefit that is accepted in discharge of the dividend debt. Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441 concerned s 44(1)(a) of the Act (set out at [6] above). It will be recalled that s 44(1) referred to dividends paid to a shareholder. Mason J said (at 456) that the purpose of the extended definition of ""paid"" in s 6 is to guard against the possibility, perhaps remote , that the word ""paid"" might be so narrowly construed that dividends credited or distributed to shareholders in circumstances where they can no longer be revoked or rescinded by the company would not constitute assessable income in the hands of shareholders. (Emphasis added.) Once declared, the present dividend could not be revoked. I do not construe the word ""paid"" in art 82(1) of ABB Australia's articles of association (see [51] above) or understand the general law notion of payment so narrowly that the effectuation of the dividend declared in favour of ABB Zurich by payment could take no form other than the transfer of money to it.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.046,0.038,0.916,0.8817,6.07795

An employee of a subsidiary was killed when an aeroplane in which he was travelling in the course of his employment crashed. The proceeds of the policy were paid to the taxpayer company. The Commissioner contended that the amount was received as ""income"" in the ordinary sense of the word. It will be noted that there was no question that the amount was received, the issue being as to its proper characterisation. 132 The High Court held that the amount was in the nature of income because it was intended to provide against loss of dividend income the taxpayer might suffer in consequence of the death or disablement of employees of its subsidiaries. In their joint judgment, Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ said (at 663 664) that the insurance monies must be considered as having been gained in the course of the parent company's business, using ""business"" in ""the broad sense which makes it relevant to the tax problem, that is to say as meaning the continuous course of conduct which the appellant was following for the derivation of income"". 133 It is common ground that the dividend of $49 million was ""income"" and I accept that ABB Zurich was carrying on business. I do not see, however, how these circumstances or the decision in Carapark determine the criterion by virtue of which, and therefore the time at which, ABB Zurich derives income consisting of dividends declared by its subsidiaries. Neither Carapark nor any other authority of which I am aware equates any form of ""carrying on of business"" at all with the trading or manufacturing activity that has been referred to as exceptional in the cases.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.022,0.07,0.908,-0.9701,-0.34734999999999916
Case382,Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan [1997] AC 313,"In Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan [1997] AC 313 Lord Mustill described the word ""paid"" as a ""slippery"" word (at 384). In the present case, it is not in dispute that the debtor, ABB Australia, paid the amount of its indebtedness on 21 June 1996: the question is whether the payment it then made to BAL was also payment to ABB Zurich. 164 Essential to the notion of payment is the agreement of a creditor to accept something as payment. If a creditor directs the debtor to pay to a third party to whom the creditor has an obligation and the debtor does so, the payment to the third party is payment to the creditor because the creditor has consented to treat it as such. Take the ordinary case of the application of s 44(1) of the Act to the declaration of a final dividend payable immediately. Could it be seriously suggested that it was not paid to the shareholder because it was paid to a third party at the direction of the shareholder?

His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question. But his affidavit and subsequent explanation makes it clear that he has answered that question by reference to the companies law for the purposes of which the relevant standards have been prepared and with which of course each of the respondents was obliged to comply. Mr Westworth's affidavit [regarding accounting practices] makes clear that he too has addressed himself to that issue, not relevant in the present proceedings. All that may be said is that if there be no impediment in the Act to bringing into account, in a case such as the present, a net profit figure as gross income, then that profit figure will need to be calculated in accordance with the accounting standards. The real issue for decision is rather a question of construction of the Act, namely, whether in a case such as the present, the scheme of the Act precludes treating as gross income the net profit calculated in accordance with the financial or actuarial method. Hill J noted earlier, however, that accounting evidence was often relevant and often highly significant in resolving issues under the Act. He gave as an example the issue whether a cash receipts or accruals basis of accounting will give ""a true reflex of the income derived by a taxpayer"" (at 443, citing Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 his Honour also cited Arthur Murray [1965] HCA 58 ; 114 CLR 314).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.14,0.03,0.83,0.9954,6.373899999999999

In particular their Honours cautioned against conflating the concept of derivation of income with derivation of profits. Their Honours referred to the fact that for the most part the notion of ""income"" directs attention to ""receipts"" by a taxpayer. Their Honours further referred to the late Professor RW Parsons's work, Income Taxation in Australia (The Law Book Company, 1985) in which the learned author stated (at [2.10]): ""For the most part, the law expresses an ordinary usage notion of derivation of a receipt"". I do not think that their Honours or the late learned author were intending to exclude the possibility that business and accounting practice might demonstrate, in the case of the particular category of income, that it is derived at a time other than upon receipt.

Case387,Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108,"The authorities cited by the applicants are St Lucia Usines and Estates Company Limited v Colonial Treasurer of St Lucia [1924] AC 508 ( St Lucia ) at 512; Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited [1938] HCA 69 ; (1938) 63 CLR 108 ( Carden's Case ) at 155; Permanent Trustee Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1940) 6 ATD 5 ( Prior's Case ) at 13; South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 253; and Bowaters Sales Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1958) 38 TC 593 ( Bowaters ) at 597 599. As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer. 68 Like the applicants, the Commissioner relies on the seminal judgment of Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The Commissioner refers to his Honour's statements to the effect that the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy (at 153), and that unless some definite direction is discoverable in the statute, the choice of the method of ascertaining ""the true income"" must depend upon the method's ""actual appropriateness"" (at 154). 103 I turn next to the judgment of Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 a seminal judgment on the question of the appropriateness of the receipts or accrual method of tax accounting for income derived. 104 The case concerned the income of a medical practitioner subsequently deceased. The issue arose under the Taxation Act 1927 1935 (SA). A question before the Court was whether the earnings or accruals method of identifying the deceased's fees income was appropriate. 105 Dixon J, with whom Rich and McTiernan JJ agreed (Latham CJ dissenting), held that the receipts basis of accounting (on which Dr Carden had furnished returns) had been the appropriate method in relation to the complete years of income during Dr Carden's lifetime (the earnings basis was held appropriate for the broken period from 1 July 1935 to his death on 15 November 1935). Accordingly, Dr Carden had not been required to return as income fees earned during those years but not paid during them, which were outstanding as ""book debts"" at the end of those years. 106 The following propositions are to be found in the judgment of Dixon J: (1) The question which of rival methods of accounting should be employed in identifying taxable income falls for the courts to determine according to legal principles, but it is a mistake to search only the legislative text for an answer, because such notions as income, profits and gains are conceptions of the world of affairs, and particularly of business, covering an infinite variety of activities, for which no single formula can be devised (at 151 152). (2) ""... in nearly every department of enterprise and employment the course of affairs and the practice of business have developed methods of estimating or computing in terms of money the result over an interval of time produced by the operations of business, by the work of the individual, or by the use of capital. The practice of these methods of computation and the general recognition of the principles upon which they proceed are responsible in a great measure for the conceptions of income, profit and gain and, therefore, may be said to enter into the determination or definition of the subject which the legislature has undertaken to tax. The courts have always regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the principles recognized or followed in business and commerce, unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question"" (at 152). (3) ""The tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy ... But the process by which the principles and practices evolved in business or general affairs are drawn upon for the solution of questions presented to courts of law almost inevitably leads to a development in the law itself. For, under our system of precedent, a decision adopting or resorting to any given accounting principle or application of principle is almost bound to settle for the future the rule to be observed and the rule thus comes to look very like a proposition of law"" (at 153 154). (4) ""Unless in the statute itself some definite direction is discoverable, ... the admissibility of the method which in fact has been pursued must depend upon its actual appropriateness ... [t]he inquiry should be whether in the circumstances of the case it is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income. We are so accustomed to commercial accounts of manufacturing or trading operations, where the object is to show the gain upon a comparison of the respective positions at the beginning and end of a period of production or trading, that it is easy to forget the reasons which underlie the application of such a method of accounting to the purpose of ascertaining taxable income. Although the field of profit-making which it covers in practice is probably much greater than any other among the manifold forms of income or revenue, it is a system of accounting which does not represent the primary or basal position from which an investigation of income for taxation purposes begins. Speaking generally, in the assessment of income the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form"" (at 154 155). (5) The expressions ""derived"" and ""arising or accruing"" ordinarily signify receipt, but not in relation to debts due to a trading company, in which case debts due but not paid must be included as income. With regard to non-trading income there must be something ""coming in"", that is to say, ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"" (at 155 quoting from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax p111). (6) ""The reasons which underlie the practice of estimating for taxation purposes the income from trade or manufacture by means of a commercial profit and loss account consist in the impracticability of computing income in any other way and in the adoption for fiscal purposes of recognized commercial principles. The computation of profits from manufacture and trading has always proceeded upon the principle that profit may be contained in stock-in-trade and 'outstandings'"" (at 155). (7) ""... a tax upon the profits or income of such a business [a manufacturing or trading business] must be understood as a tax upon the profits or income computed according to the system, because, according to common understanding and commercial principles, that is the method of determining the profits"" (at 156). (8) The word ""derived"" is the equivalent of ""arising or accruing"" ( Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119 at 133), and none of these three words, nor the words ""income"", ""profit"" or ""gain"" in the statute, throw any light on the question of which basis of accounting is appropriate to reflect income in the circumstances of a particular case (at 157). (9) ""Where there is nothing analogous to a stock of vendible articles to be acquired or produced and carried by the taxpayer, where outstandings on the expenditure side do not correspond to, and are not naturally connected with, the outstandings on the earnings side, and where there is no fund of circulating capital from which income or profit must be detached for actual enjoyment, but where, on the contrary, the receipts represent in substance a reward for professional skill and personal work to which the expenditure on the other side of the account contributes only in a subsidiary or minor degree, then I think according to ordinary conceptions the receipts basis forms a fair and appropriate foundation for estimating professional income. But this is subject to one qualification. There must be continuity in the practice of the profession"" (at 157 158). 107 The factual circumstances of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 are also far removed from those of the present case. Dixon J's reasons suggest, however, three things. First, we should expect to be able to identify the meaning and timing of the derivation of dividend income, not necessarily simply by exploring the text of the Act, such as the term ""income"" or the term ""derived"", but by reference to relevant business and accounting practice. Second, trading and manufacturing companies have particular features that make an accrual or earnings basis appropriate for them, that are not features of a group holding company such as ABB Zurich, namely, a depletion in a stock of vendible articles on one side of the ledger that would be apt to give a misleading picture as to the company's gain or loss over a period if the corresponding earnings (book debts) arising from the depletion during that period were not shown as income on the other side of the ledger. Third, generally speaking, in order to see whether income has been derived, we should ask whether the income has come home to the taxpayer in a realised or immediately realisable form. 108 Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 suggests that in the absence of features taking the case out of the ordinary or evidence of business and accounting practice pointing to a different result, I should treat the present dividend as income derived if and when it came home to ABB Zurich in a realised or immediately realisable form. 109 Prior's Case 6 ATD 5 was concerned with the application of s 19 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 33 to a capitalisation by a Deed of Dissolution of Partnership dated 13 August 1932, and therefore within the financial year ended 30 June 1933, of an amount of &#8356;2,097 that represented a balance of interest outstanding by one former partner to the other. The sum of &#8356;2,097 was included in a sum of &#8356;8,388 that was agreed to represent the total amount owing by the former partner to the other. As part of the agreement on dissolution, the amount of &#8356;8,388 was secured by a charge ""on property already heavily mortgaged and quite incapable of producing a surplus out of which the amount representing interest could be paid"" (at 13). 110 The interest was not paid but was carried to a capital account, and in that sense capitalised. Section 19 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922 1933 was all but identical to s 19 of the Act (set out at [9] above the words ""or money"" did not appear in the earlier version). Rich J, with whom Starke and McTiernan JJ agreed, considered that the facts showed that the taxpayer got nothing except a new obligation to pay in exchange for the existing obligation to pay, which made him ""no nearer getting his money or of transferring it into anything of any value"" (at 12). Rather colourfully, his Honour said: ""[a]ll that happened in this case was to change a forlorn hope of interest into a still more forlorn hope of capital"" (ibid). Rich J thought that in order to see whether income is being derived, ""one must look to realities"", adding that while usually payment of interest by cheque involves receipt of income, ""payment by a valueless cheque does not"" (at 13). Like Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108, his Honour also quoted from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax , p111: ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"". 111 Prior's Case 6 ATD 5 stands for the proposition that s 19 is not engaged where there is no increase in the taxpayer's resources. There was such an increase in the resources of ABB Zurich upon declaration of the dividend. It was certain that the dividend would be paid; it was ABB Zurich's decision to fix a future date for payment; and immediately after declaration of the dividend ABB Zurich was able to sell the right to be paid it. Prior's Case is therefore of little relevance to the present case. 112 Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 58 ; (1965) 114 CLR 314 ( Arthur Murray ) was, in a sense, the converse of Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108. The taxpayer company received fees for dancing lessons yet to be given. It placed the fees in a suspense account until the lessons were given, when it transferred them to its revenue account. The High Court held that the fees were not assessable income at the time of receipt. 113 In their joint judgment, Barwick CJ, Kitto and Taylor JJ said that Dixon J's reference in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 to monies having ""come home"" to the taxpayer, was a reference, not simply to receipt, but to the reaching of a situation in which monies received might properly be counted as gains completely made, so that there was neither legal nor business unsoundness in regarding them, without qualification, as income derived. Their Honours stated (at 318): The ultimate inquiry in either kind of case, of course, must be whether that which has taken place, be it the earning or the receipt, is enough by itself to satisfy the general understanding among practical business people of what constitutes a derivation of income. A conclusion as to what that understanding is may be assisted by considering standard accountancy methods, for they have been evolved in the business community for the very purpose of reflecting received opinions as to the sound view to take of particular kinds of items. ... A judicial decision as to whether an amount received but not yet earned or an amount earned but not yet received is income must depend basically upon the judicial understanding of the meaning which the word conveys to those whose concern it is to observe the distinctions it implies. What ultimately matters is the concept; book-keeping methods are but evidence of the concept. Their Honours noted that it was agreed that according to established accountancy and commercial principles, in the case of a business selling goods or supplying services, amounts received in advance of the goods being delivered or the services supplied are not regarded as income until the goods are delivered or the services supplied. 114 Their Honours recognised that where statute lays down a test for the inclusion of particular kinds of receipts in assessable income, commercial and accounting practice cannot be substituted for the test, but said there was no such test in the case before the Court, the only relevant word being ""income"", which was to be understood according to ""the vocabulary of business affairs"" (at 320). 115 Subsection (1) of s 128B does not, in my view, lay down a test of the kind contemplated by their Honours. The subsection invokes the notion of ""income ... derived"", and I am required to have regard to general commercial and accounting practice, if evidence of it is put before the Court, as to when income consisting of a dividend declared in the circumstances of the present case is regarded as having ""come home"" to the parent company. 116 In South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235, Dixon J's judgment in Carden's Case was again referred to by the High Court. In a joint judgment, Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 252) that in accordance with Dixon J's statement in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 at 152 (see [106] (1), (2) above), ""the courts have placed reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy in order to arrive at an assessment of income, the object being 'to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realised or immediately realizable form'"" (their Honours were quoting from Dixon J in Carden's Case [1938] HCA 69 ; 63 CLR 108 at 155). 146 In Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 434, Hill J, with whom Jenkinson and Einfeld JJ agreed, cautioned against a too ready reliance on business and accounting practice relating to preparation of the company's profit and loss account required in accordance with s 269(1) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code (at 443 446). His Honour stated (at 445 446): With respect to his Honour, who presumably must be taken as having decided otherwise, I do not think that the accounting evidence in the present case establishes that the amount derived each year by applying the financial or actuarial method represents income in ordinary concepts. What that evidence establishes is that the outcome of the finance or actuarial method is an appropriate figure to be used in the preparation of the profit and loss account of the respondent for the year in accordance with the Companies (New South Wales) Code : s 269(1). If the relevant issue were the determination of the profit of the respondents, or whether that profit was to be seen as on revenue account, the evidence would clearly be most cogent. But it must be remembered that the role of the accounting standards is in the determination of profit so as to ensure that financial statements, required to be prepared by statute, give a true and fair view and not the determination of ""income"", notwithstanding that those two concepts may, as will be seen, sometimes overlap. Thus Professor Walker [an expert witness] states that he has been asked to advise as to the correct method of accounting in relation to the leases in question.

Case389,Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does.

Case392,Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177,"The Commissioner submits that for the purposes of identifying the appropriate basis of accounting, the authorities show or suggest that a holding company is classified as a trading company. He cites Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1966) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ) at 663 664; Esquire Nominees Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 32 ; (1973) 129 CLR 177 ( Esquire Nominees ) at 212 per Barwick CJ, 221 per Menzies J; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 ( Brookton ) at 469 per Aickin J; and Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 99 ATC 5193 ( BHP v FCT ) at [48] per Kenny J. 134 The Commissioner relies on a statement in Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 by Barwick CJ (at 212) that a company may make profits without trading in goods or commodities, or, for that matter, in securities, and that it may do so simply through its investment portfolio, indeed, through investment in a single subsidiary. 135 Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 concerned an issue over the location of the source from which income was derived. The taxpayer company, Esquire Nominees Ltd, was incorporated in Norfolk Island, as was Mitchell Credits Ltd. Each had its registered office and central management and control in Norfolk Island. In the year ended 30 June 1969, Esquire Nominees Ltd received a dividend from Mitchell Credits Ltd. Mitchell Credits Ltd derived the funds for the payment of the dividend from a dividend which it received from Pharmaceutical Investments Ltd, which was also incorporated in Norfolk Island. That company paid the dividend to Mitchell Credits Ltd from funds constituted by a dividend it received from an Australian company, whose income came from dividends paid to it by another Australian company carrying on business in Australia. 136 Barwick CJ (at 212) said that the place where a company makes its investment income is the place where it has its central management and control, whereas the place where a trading or manufacturing company makes its income is the place where its trading or manufacturing activities are carried on. 137 The High Court held that Esquire Nominees Ltd was a resident of Norfolk Island and that the source of the dividend, the fund out of which Mitchell Credits Ltd declared it, was within Norfolk Island. 139 The Commissioner also refers to a passage in the judgment of Aickin J in Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441. His Honour stated (at 469) that in the case of a company that had no activity other than the receipt of dividends from shares that it had purchased, it would ordinarily be regarded as carrying on a business, even if it did not actively manage its portfolio of investments, whereas an individual in the same circumstances would not necessarily be regarded as carrying on such a business. Aickin J cited Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 at 212 per Barwick CJ and 221 per Menzies J. Again, the statement is relevant only to the question whether ABB Zurich carried on a business. I accept that it did. 140 Finally, the Commissioner relies on BHP v FCT 99 ATC 5193, in which Kenny J said (at [48]) that the taxpayer company carried on businesses which included holding shares in, and managing, its subsidiaries. Her Honour stated, citing Esquire Nominees [1972] HCA 32 ; 129 CLR 177 and Brookton [1981] HCA 28 ; 147 CLR 441, that the holding of shares in subsidiaries can of itself constitute the carrying of a business for the purposes of s 51(1) of the Act.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.054,0.017,0.929,0.9692,6.3552
Case393,Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.083,0.02,0.896,0.9913,6.40355
Case394,Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119,"The following propositions are to be found in the judgment of Dixon J: (1) The question which of rival methods of accounting should be employed in identifying taxable income falls for the courts to determine according to legal principles, but it is a mistake to search only the legislative text for an answer, because such notions as income, profits and gains are conceptions of the world of affairs, and particularly of business, covering an infinite variety of activities, for which no single formula can be devised (at 151 152). (2) ""... in nearly every department of enterprise and employment the course of affairs and the practice of business have developed methods of estimating or computing in terms of money the result over an interval of time produced by the operations of business, by the work of the individual, or by the use of capital. The practice of these methods of computation and the general recognition of the principles upon which they proceed are responsible in a great measure for the conceptions of income, profit and gain and, therefore, may be said to enter into the determination or definition of the subject which the legislature has undertaken to tax. The courts have always regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the principles recognized or followed in business and commerce, unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question"" (at 152). (3) ""The tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance upon the conceptions of business and the principles and practices of commercial accountancy ... But the process by which the principles and practices evolved in business or general affairs are drawn upon for the solution of questions presented to courts of law almost inevitably leads to a development in the law itself. For, under our system of precedent, a decision adopting or resorting to any given accounting principle or application of principle is almost bound to settle for the future the rule to be observed and the rule thus comes to look very like a proposition of law"" (at 153 154). (4) ""Unless in the statute itself some definite direction is discoverable, ... the admissibility of the method which in fact has been pursued must depend upon its actual appropriateness ... [t]he inquiry should be whether in the circumstances of the case it is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income. We are so accustomed to commercial accounts of manufacturing or trading operations, where the object is to show the gain upon a comparison of the respective positions at the beginning and end of a period of production or trading, that it is easy to forget the reasons which underlie the application of such a method of accounting to the purpose of ascertaining taxable income. Although the field of profit-making which it covers in practice is probably much greater than any other among the manifold forms of income or revenue, it is a system of accounting which does not represent the primary or basal position from which an investigation of income for taxation purposes begins. Speaking generally, in the assessment of income the object is to discover what gains have during the period of account come home to the taxpayer in a realized or immediately realizable form"" (at 154 155). (5) The expressions ""derived"" and ""arising or accruing"" ordinarily signify receipt, but not in relation to debts due to a trading company, in which case debts due but not paid must be included as income. With regard to non-trading income there must be something ""coming in"", that is to say, ""for income tax purposes receivability without receipt is nothing"" (at 155 quoting from Sir Houldsworth Shaw &amp; Baker, Law of Income Tax p111). (6) ""The reasons which underlie the practice of estimating for taxation purposes the income from trade or manufacture by means of a commercial profit and loss account consist in the impracticability of computing income in any other way and in the adoption for fiscal purposes of recognized commercial principles. The computation of profits from manufacture and trading has always proceeded upon the principle that profit may be contained in stock-in-trade and 'outstandings'"" (at 155). (7) ""... a tax upon the profits or income of such a business [a manufacturing or trading business] must be understood as a tax upon the profits or income computed according to the system, because, according to common understanding and commercial principles, that is the method of determining the profits"" (at 156). (8) The word ""derived"" is the equivalent of ""arising or accruing"" ( Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; (1917) 23 CLR 119 at 133), and none of these three words, nor the words ""income"", ""profit"" or ""gain"" in the statute, throw any light on the question of which basis of accounting is appropriate to reflect income in the circumstances of a particular case (at 157). (9) ""Where there is nothing analogous to a stock of vendible articles to be acquired or produced and carried by the taxpayer, where outstandings on the expenditure side do not correspond to, and are not naturally connected with, the outstandings on the earnings side, and where there is no fund of circulating capital from which income or profit must be detached for actual enjoyment, but where, on the contrary, the receipts represent in substance a reward for professional skill and personal work to which the expenditure on the other side of the account contributes only in a subsidiary or minor degree, then I think according to ordinary conceptions the receipts basis forms a fair and appropriate foundation for estimating professional income. But this is subject to one qualification. There must be continuity in the practice of the profession"" (at 157 158). 128 Bowaters 38 TC 593 is said to be against the Commissioner's contention in the present case. I note that I do not see any relevant distinction between the concepts ""arising"" in ss 19 and 20(1) of the Finance Act 1937 (UK) and ""derived"" in the Australian s 128B(1): see Harding v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1917] HCA 13 ; 23 CLR 119 at 133 noted at [106] above.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.098,0.014,0.888,0.9985,6.41075
Case395,Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999),"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050].

There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law.

Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment.

This third submission depends largely, though not entirely, on Norman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 21 ; (1963) 109 CLR 9 ( Norman ). 36 I will elaborate on the parties' submissions below. 37 In their outline of opening, the applicants set out the following facts which, although elaborated upon by the Commissioner as noted below, were not in issue between the parties: Parties [ABB Australia] (formerly called Asea Brown Boveri Pty Limited) ... is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of New South Wales; (b) the issued capital of which during the period from (at least) 1 May 1996 to 30 June 1996 comprised 53,072,944 ordinary shares of A$1.50 each and 42,827,055 ordinary shares of A$1.00 each, all of which were registered in the name of the Second Applicant (as beneficial owner) except for 1 ordinary share of $1.00 which was registered in the name of Patelhold Patentverwertungs und Elektro Holding AG on bare trust for the Second Applicant (as beneficial owner); (b) which is, and was at all material times, a resident of Australia for the purposes of [the 1936 Act]. [ABB Zurich] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of Switzerland; (b) which is, and was at all material times, a non-resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. [BZW] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of England and Wales; (b) which was at all material times a non-resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. [BAL] is a company: (a) incorporated pursuant to the laws of New South Wales; (b) which was at all material times a resident of Australia for the purposes of the 1936 Act. Declaration of the Dividend On 22 May 1996, the directors of ABB Australia resolved that the declaration and payment of a final dividend of A$49,000,000 for the year ended 31 December 1995 payable on 21 June 1996 to the registered shareholders of the company as at 30 May 1996 be recommended to the shareholders at an annual general meeting. On 30 May 1996, in accordance with Article 82 of the Articles of Association of ABB Australia, the members of the company resolved at an annual general meeting that a final dividend of A$49,000,000 be paid to members holding shares in the company as at 30 May 1996 and that the dividend be payable on 21 June 1996 (the "" Dividend ""). Assignment of the right to the Dividend On 3 June 1996 in Zurich, Switzerland: (a) ABB Zurich made an offer in writing to BZW (the "" First Offer "") to assign to BZW absolutely all of ABB Zurich's right to receive the Dividend on the terms set out in the First Offer; and (b) the First Offer was accepted by Mr Althans, as attorney for BZW, orally in accordance with its terms. The First Offer, which was expressed to be governed by English law, included terms to the following effect: (a) the consideration payable by BZW to ABB Zurich for the assignment was a sum payable in Australian dollars calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Appendix 1 to the First Offer (the "" Price ""), which was ultimately determined to be A$48,816,995; (b) the Price was payable to ABB Zurich by wire transfer no later than 5 June 1996; (c) following acceptance of the offer, ABB Zurich would give a direction to ABB Australia to pay the Dividend to such bank account as shall be designated by BZW or a ""Permitted Assign""; (d) ABB Zurich agreed that BZW may without the consent of ABB Zurich, assign to a Permitted Assign the benefit of all or any of ABB Zurich's obligations under the First Offer and/or any benefit arising under or out of the First Offer. BZW did not give notice to ABB Australia of the assignment of ABB Zurich's right to receive the Dividend. On 4 June 1996, in Zurich, Switzerland: (a) BZW made an offer in writing to BAL (the "" Second Offer "") to assign to BAL all of BZW's right to receive the Dividend and the benefits of the First Offer; (b) the Second Offer was accepted by Mr B Gill, as attorney for BAL, orally in accordance with its terms. The Second Offer, which is also expressed to be governed by English law, provided that the consideration payable by BAL to BZW for the assignment was the amount of A$48,826,480. On 5 June 1996: (a) BAL paid the consideration for the assignment under the Second Offer (being the amount of A$48,826,480) to BZW; (b) BZW paid the Price (being the amount of A$48,816,995) to ABB Zurich; (c) BAL gave to ABB Zurich written notice of the assignment under the Second Offer and a written request that ABB Zurich instruct ABB Australia to pay the amount of A$49,000,000 in respect of the Dividend to an identified bank account of BAL at the National Australia Bank in Sydney ""for value 21 June 1996"". On 6 June 1996, ABB Zurich gave to ABB Australia a written direction which provided relevantly as follows: ""You are irrevocably directed to pay the debt of AUD 49,000,000 due and owing by you to ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland, to Barclays Australia Limited, 22 nd Floor, 255 George Street, GPO Box 4675, Sydney NSW 2001, Australia. The payment must be made for value 21 June 1996 to the following account [there followed particulars of an agreement at the National Australia Bank in Sydney]. Payment of the Dividend On 20 June 1996, ABB Australia, by special resolution passed at a duly convened meeting of its members, amended its Articles of Association by the addition of a new Article 82(3) as follows: ""Members may at any time by way of a written notice direct the Company to pay the amount of any dividend declared pursuant to Article 82(1) to a party nominated in that Notice. The company shall on receipt of any such Notice pay the dividend in accordance with the terms of the Notice."" On 21 June 1996, ABB Australia paid the amount of $49,000,000 to BAL in accordance with the direction referred to ... above. On or about 30 June 1996, the payment of the Dividend was recorded in the accounts of ABB Australia by the following journal entry: Dr Retained Earnings Dividend Paid $49,000,000 Cr Monies on deposit ABB $49,000,000. Apart from the accounting entry referred to in the previous paragraph, no other originating entry (being a debit or credit entry) was made in the books of ABB Australia in respect of the debt arising on the declaration of the Dividend or its payment. Dispute with the Respondent On 16 December 2003 the Respondent sent a letter to ABB Australia which stated that ABB Australia was obliged pursuant to s.221YL(1) of the 1936 Act to make a deduction from the Dividend when it was paid on 21 June 1996 which was not made, and required ABB Australia to pay to him pursuant to s.221YQ(1) of the 1936 Act an amount of $15,540,581.40 comprising unpaid withholding tax of $7,350,000, unpaid additional tax by way of penalty of $3,082,367.90 and unpaid general interest charge of $5,108,213.50. Also on 16 December 2003, the Respondent sent a letter to ABB Zurich which stated that ABB Zurich was liable to pay withholding tax, pursuant to s.128B and s.128C of the 1936 Act, in respect of the Dividend, and required ABB Zurich to pay to him the amount of $15,540,581.40 comprising unpaid withholding tax of $7,350,000, unpaid additional tax by way of penalty of $3,082,367.90 and unpaid general interest charge of $5,108,213.50. 189 The Commissioner relies, first, on Norman [1963] HCA 21 ; 109 CLR 9 at 16 per Dixon CJ. 190 In Norman , by deed dated 21 December 1956 a taxpayer purported to assign to his wife by way of gift, relevantly, all the interest, dividends and other income arising from two estates in which the taxpayer had a beneficial interest. Subsequently, company shares representing the taxpayer's interest in the estates were transferred to him and he was registered as the shareholder in respect of them. In the year of income ended 30 June 1958, after the shares had been transferred to the taxpayer, dividends were declared on them. The companies posted to the taxpayer cheques for the dividends drawn in his favour. He endorsed them when necessary and had them paid into his wife's bank account a practice of which his wife was aware. The companies had no notice of the deed. 191 The amounts of the dividends were returned as income of the taxpayer's wife, but the Commissioner contended that they should have been returned as income of the taxpayer. 192 In the passage (at 16) cited, Dixon CJ stated: So far as the dividend is concerned, I think the structure of s 44 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1958 makes it impossible that future undeclared dividends should be assigned by the shareholder so as to exclude him from liability to include the dividends when declared in his assessable income. Section 44 and the sections which follow are framed to deal specially with the case of members of companies who are entitled to dividends. The whole question of tax upon the profits of companies is dealt with specially in the Act, including the scheme relating to rebates. It would become impossible if a shareholder could without transferring his shares assign a future undeclared dividend so as to exclude the operation of the provisions. Menzies J (with whom Owen J agreed) made generally similar comments in relation to the policy underlying s 44(1). Menzies J stated (at 23): I am disposed to think that s 44(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act requires that when the taxpayer received the dividends paid to him by the companies in which he was a shareholder, as he did, that those dividends should form part of his assessable income. Of course, had he been a trustee of the shares the provisions of Div 6 of the Act would have applied. 193 The Commissioner submits that the comments made by Dixon CJ and Menzies J in Norman have greater force in relation to the circumstances of the present case because the dividend was declared prior to the equitable assignments, whereas in Norman the deed of assignment preceded the declaration of the dividend. 194 There are several differences between the facts of Norman and those of the present case. In Norman : &#8226; the equitable assignment was by way of gift whereas ABB Zurich contracted to sell for valuable consideration; &#8226; the equitable assignment was of prospective or hoped for future dividends, whereas in the present case the equitable assignments were of an existing debt arising from a declaration of dividend that had already occurred; &#8226; the terms of the declaration of dividends did not provide for a postponement of payment, whereas the terms of the declaration of the dividend in the present case provided for a deferral of payment from 30 May 1996 to 21 June 1996; &#8226; the companies drew the cheques for dividends already due and payable in favour of the taxpayer and posted them to him, and he endorsed them where required and paid them into his wife's bank account, whereas ABB Australia paid the amount of the dividend to BAL. The statement by Dixon CJ refers in terms only to assignment of ""a future undeclared dividend"". The statement by Menzies J refers to the fact that the dividends were paid to the shareholder. 195 The facts in Norman which their Honours must be taken to have had in mind were extreme: the companies, having no notice of the earlier purported gift, drew the dividend cheques in favour of a shareholder and posted them to him. In substance, it was he who effected payment to his wife. 197 The applicants submit that s 44 of the Act cannot determine the capacity of a taxpayer to assign income (while Norman [1963] HCA 21 ; 109 CLR 9 concerned s 44, the Commissioner's submission expressly stated that it proceeded on the basis that s 128B and s 44(1) ""are to be construed consistently""). 198 The applicants further submit: The ""special characteristics"" relied on by the Respondent do not subject the rights in respect of debts arising on the declaration of dividends, or in respect of the future property being the expected dividends, to any different consequences in the case of an assignment. The assignee, of course, takes subject to any disabilities on the subject matter of the assignment flowing from the relationship between the assignor and the company, but this does not preclude assignment nor its tax consequences. It is not to the point that the ""source"" of the dividend is ""an effectuation or realisation of the rights obtained by the acquisition of the share;"" the same could be said in respect of interest and principal, rents and land or royalty and intellectual property. 199 It is not in dispute that the declaration of the dividend gave rise to a debt. I do not understand that there is any dispute that s 12 of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) or the equivalent United Kingdom provision, s 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK), made the debt assignable at law ""subject to equities having priority over the assignee"". The assignment in the present case was not under the statute, but it is useful to note that if it had been, there would, in my opinion, have been no ""equity"" in favour of the Commissioner in respect of withholding tax for three reasons. First, I do not think that the liability of a non-resident to pay withholding tax is an ""equity"" for present purposes. Second, ABB Zurich was not liable to pay withholding tax prior to the assignment, and so the assignment could not take effect ""subject to"" that supposed equity. Third, the ""subject to equities"" qualification relates to the position of the assignee (BAL in the present case) not that of the assignor (ABB Zurich in the present case).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.068,0.025,0.907,0.9984,6.4514
Case402,Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.123,0.01,0.867,0.9818,6.3233

As well, the applicants refer to the Commissioner's Public Ruling TR 98/1 at [19], in which the Commissioner has said that as a general rule, the receipts method is appropriate to determine income derived from investments, although there are exceptions, such as in the case of interest from a business of money lending carried on by the taxpayer.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.06,0.022,0.918,0.7003,5.41305
Case404,Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504,"Prior to the introduction of those provisions, there was a well established distinction between final and interim dividends. A declaration of a final dividend by the shareholders gave rise to an immediate debt owed by the company to the shareholders, whereas a resolution by the directors to pay an interim dividend did not do so: Potel v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] 2 All ER 504 at 511 512; Industrial Equity Limited v Blackburn [1977] HCA 59 ; (1977) 137 CLR 567 at 572; Marra Developments Ltd v BW Rofe Pty Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 616 at 625; Brookton Co-operative Society Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 at 455. Thus, a declaration of a final dividend could not be revoked and the company's indebtedness to its shareholders eliminated, if profits ceased to be available to fund the dividend between the time of the declaration and the time fixed for payment. A decision of the directors to pay an interim dividend, on the other hand, could always be revoked down to the time fixed for payment.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.043,0.048,0.909,0.2732,3.9612000000000003
Case405,Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603,"The Commissioner relies on the following special characteristics of dividends: (a) that the division of a company's profits among its shareholders by the declaration of a dividend is ""an effectuation or realisation of the rights obtained by the acquisition of the share"" (citing Chief Commissioner of State Revenue (NSW) v Dick Smith Electronics Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 3 ; (2005) 221 CLR 496 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [25] [26], quoting from the judgment of Dixon J in Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1948] HCA 28 ; (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 153); (b) that in the winding up of a company, debts owed by the company to its members in their capacity as members, including debts arising from the declaration of a dividend, are postponed until all debts owed to, or claims made by, persons other than as members of the company have been satisfied: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 563A (in 1996 the comparable provision was s 563A of the Corporations Law , which was in identical terms); (c) on an assignment of a debt created by the declaration of a dividend, the debt remains subject to the ""equity"" of the ordinary creditors proving in priority (the Commissioner cites Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603 ( Simpson )). 200 The Commissioner's present submission draws attention to certain special features of a dividend debt, and Simpson [1964-65] NSWR 603 exemplifies them. In that case, a company was indebted to shareholders who were trustees of twelve trusts for &#8356;34,471.18s.1d on account of dividends that had been declared. The debt was recorded in the company's books. The trustees notified the company that in accordance with the trusts, a person had elected to become the beneficiary of each trust fund. Accordingly, the company transferred the amount of its indebtedness to the trustees into an account in the name of the beneficiary. 201 Upon liquidation of the company, the beneficiary sought to prove for the debt of &#8356;34,471.18s.1d. The liquidator rejected the proof on the basis that s 200(1)(g) of the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) applied. The effect of that provision was that on a winding up a debt owed by the company to a person in the person's capacity as a member of the company, such as by way of dividend, was, relevantly, deemed not to be a debt payable to that member (cf the postponement now provided for in s 563A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) referred to at [196] above). 202 The beneficiary submitted (1) that the sum owed to her was not by way of dividend, and (2) that she was not a member but an assignee from a member.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.068,0.037,0.895,0.8674,6.0049

Case407,Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187),"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously. As Lord Millett summarises the position, ""[t]he trust ceases to be defeasible or contingent; the vendor becomes a fiduciary; and the purchaser has all the remedies of a beneficiary under an ordinary trust"", citing Rose v Watson (1864) 10 HLCas 672 (11 ER 1187) esp per Lord Cranworth at 683 4 (ER 1192), and see also Lake v Bayliss [1974] 2 All ER 1114.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.083,0.02,0.896,0.9913,6.40355

After selling its estates and business in St Lucia, the taxpayer company did not reside or carry on business there, but was owed part of the purchase price at interest. Twelve months' interest fell due on 30 November 1921 but was not paid. Whether the company was liable to pay income tax in respect of the year 1921 on that interest depended on whether that interest was ""income arising or accruing"" to the company derived from a source in the colony. 101 The Privy Council rejected the Colonial Treasurer's contention that the interest accrued to the company in 1921. Their Lordships stated (at 512 513): The words ""income arising or accruing"" are not equivalent to the words ""Debts arising or accruing"". To give them that meaning is to ignore the word ""income"". The words mean ""money arising or accruing by way of income"". There must be a coming in to satisfy the word ""income"". This is a sense which is assisted or confirmed by the word ""received"" in the proviso at the end of s 4, subs 1. If the taxpayer be the holder of stock of a foreign Government carrying say 5 per cent interest, and the Government is that of a defaulting State which does not pay the interest, the taxpayer has neither received nor has there accrued to him any income in respect of that stock. A debt has accrued to him but income has not. It does not follow that income is confined to that which the taxpayer actually receives. Where income tax is deducted at the source the taxpayer never receives the sum deducted but it accrues to him. It is said, and truly, that a commercial company, in preparing its balance sheet and profit and loss account, does not confine itself to its actual receipts does not prepare a mere cash account but values its book debts and its stock in trade and so on and calculates its profits accordingly. From the practice of commerce and of accountants and from the necessity of the case this is so. But this is far from establishing that income arises or accrues from ... an investment which fails to pay the interest due. I do not think it necessary to refer further to s 4(1)'s reference to ""received"" that is mentioned in this passage. 102 The sale that gave rise to the liability to pay the interest appears to have been a one off, indeed a final, sale of the company's estates in St Lucia. The facts are therefore far removed from those of the present case in which ABB Australia was one of 1,000 wholly owned subsidiaries of ABB Zurich, and the latter company, in its role as shareholder, declared the dividend and framed the terms of payment. On the other hand, the passage does distinguish between money falling due and payable (in the present case, the amount of the dividend had not fallen due and payable as at 30 May 1996) and money coming in.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.099,0.043,0.857,0.9935,6.4182500000000005
Case412,Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law.

Case413,Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369,"The following summary account of general principles is in accord with his Lordship's affidavit. (1) The English legislation that made a ""debt or other legal thing in action"" assignable in law was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) and the provision is now found in s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (UK). (2) Although the common law did not recognise assignments of legal choses in action, equitable assignments of them were recognised. Lord Millett states that ""[e]quitable assignments of legal choses in action are of great antiquity"". I note that in his recent scholarly work, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006), Dr Tolhurst states (at [2.16]): By the beginning of the eighteenth century, it was settled that equity would recognise the assignment of a legal chose in action and viewed the common law's position as ""absurd"" [ Master v Miller (1791) 4 TR 320 at 340 (100 ER 1042 at 1053) per Buller J]. (3) The statutory provision did not impair the efficacy of equitable assignments, and neither the equitable assignment nor notice of it to the debtor (if notice of it was given) was required to be expressed in any particular manner, and might be written or oral in form, so long as the intention to assign and (if notice of it was given) the intention to give notice of an assignment were plain: William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Company Limited [1905] AC 454 at 462 per Lord Macnaghten. (4) Notice to the debtor was not a requirement of a valid equitable assignment, as it is in the case of a valid legal assignment under the statutory provision: Gorringe v Irwell India Rubber and Gutta Percha Works (1866) 34 Ch D 128; Ward and Pemberton v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 at 392. As between assignor and assignee, an equitable assignment is complete and binding from the time when it is made or when the assignor has agreed, for valuable consideration, to make it. (5) The debtor's state of mind is irrelevant. However, the debtor's liability will be discharged if it pays the assignor before receiving notice of the assignment. In such a case, the assignor will hold the amount paid to it upon trust for the assignee. (6) Notice to the debtor need not be in any particular form and may be given by any party. Lord Millett states: ""The question is whether the debtor has notice of the assignment or has been put on enquiry whether there has been an assignment. If he goes ahead without enquiry and pays the assignor, he is at risk of having to pay twice."" (7) Because a debt cannot be sold in a ready market elsewhere, a contract to assign a debt is, subject to impediments that may exist, specifically enforceable in equity. Accordingly, an equitable assignment need not purport to be an actual present assignment, and may take the form of a contract, for valuable consideration, to assign: see Cotton v Heyl [1930] 1 Ch 510 at 520 521; In Re Warren; ex parte Wheeler v The Trustee in Bankruptcy [1938] Ch 725 at 734 6; and see Tolhurst, op cit at [7.16]. (8) Whether or not it is correct to say that the assignor holds the legal chose in action on trust for the assignee before the promised consideration is paid, once the promised consideration is paid, it does. It will then hold the benefit of the obligor's undertaking upon a constructive trust for the assignee, even if specific performance of the contract to assign between assignor and assignee could not have been obtained by the assignee previously.

It dealt with that evidence largely by setting out his responses to various documentary exhibits put to him. The exhibits were not always identified with clarity. 38 The present case is not about a failure on the part of the Tribunal to include in its reasons the findings on material questions of fact which it has made.

Case421,Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313,"The Tribunal's obligation is to give its reasons for its decision in the sense explained earlier. In so doing it is not required to express itself with the precision that might be required of a court of law. As Morling and Wilcox JJ said in Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (Qld) (1987) 76 ALR 313 (at 328): 'The tribunal is an administrative body and, whilst errors of law made by it are susceptible to correction by this court, its decisions should not be too closely scrutinised for the purpose of searching for errors of law in what may be imprecise language.' In my opinion, the Tribunal made a finding of fact that within six months Mr Homewood would be destitute (absent the disability support pension). It had regard to his asset position in coming to that conclusion. The complaint that it has not adequately disclosed its reasons for so concluding amounts to little more than a complaint about its findings of fact. 46 The Secretary accepted, by reference to [44] of the Tribunal's reasons, that the amount available for Mr Homewood's support could arguably be fixed at a lower range of between $20,000 and $30,000. That is not a reading of the Tribunal's reasons which is particularly generous to Mr Homewood. It is to be noted that the assets giving rise to those figures are comprised of 'coin collections and other collectibles', '20 boxes of items' 'DVDs ...; a motor vehicle worth less than $5,000'. 47 Having regard to the nature of the assets to which the Tribunal adverted in its reasons, its finding that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months was open to it. That finding formed a base, in principle, for the exercise of the discretion under s 1184K(1) of the Act. The way in which it approached the exercise of that discretion was adequately explained by reference to its finding of fact. While it may be argued that a more elaborate and principled approach by reference to the rules governing the fixing of preclusion periods under the Act would have been preferable, that is not the basis upon which the Tribunal's decision is attacked in this case. It is attacked only on the basis that it has failed to give adequate reasons.

Case422,Biscayne Partners Pty Ltd v Valance Corp Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 874,"The reasons why a failure to complain may have relevance or may assist in resolution of an issue were stated by Einstein J in Biscayne Partners Pty Ltd v Valance Corp Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 874 at [150] . What underlies his Honour's explanation is that a failure to complain may point to a finding of absence of any real ground for complaint or reliance where a plaintiff would be expected to have spoken. But the principle assumes that the person had knowledge of the alleged misrepresentation at the relevant time. That is to say, how can a failure to complain about that which the party was unaware have any real probative value? 13 Whether the failure to complain goes to credit or to an issue in the proceeding will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. In the present proceedings it may be that the proposed cross-examination goes in some way to the issue of reliance as shown in the authorities relied upon by the respondents. However, in light of the material which the respondents wish to explore as set out in the draft list of proposed topics of cross-examination, I am inclined to the view that the cross-examination will go in some significant respects to Mr Seward's credit. 14 To the extent that the proposed cross-examination will go to credit I am not satisfied that it would have substantial probative value. Moreover, I am not persuaded that a sufficient evidentiary basis has been established on the present motion to warrant reopening cross-examination. In particular, it appears from evidence adduced in the proceedings that in the period from 2001-2002 BWC was suffering increasing financial difficulties but it is not established on this motion that Mr Seward was at that time aware, as the applicants contend, that Quadrant had allowed Mr Blom to present projections to the applicants without revealing that Blom's earlier (and less optimistic) projections had failed. 15 Insofar as the respondents call in aid the ""most walks of life"" ordinary human nature test referred to by Einstein J in Biscayne , the material referred to in the respondents' affidavits on the motion seems to me to be insufficient to justify the exercise of my discretion. I do not consider that the topics listed in the draft list illustrate with a sufficient degree of confidence that the evidence would have sufficient evidentiary value to justify me in exercising my discretion in this matter.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.093,0.097,0.809,-0.4588,1.3952

Case432,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 228 CLR 566,"As noted earlier, the applicant came to have his transitional (permanent) visa by operation of reg 4 (1) of the Transitional Provisions Regulations, which provided: Subject to regulation 5, [which is not relevant in these proceedings] if, immediately before 1 September 1994, a non-citizen was in Australia as the holder of a permanent entry permit, that entry permit continues in effect on and after 1 September 1994 as a transitional (permanent) visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia. The explanatory statement to the Transitional Provisions Regulations stated that reg 4 was ""designed to ensure that, from 1 September 1994, all visas and entry permits held immediately before that date [were] converted into one of two transitional visa classes by operation of law"". The validity of reg 4(1) of the Transitional Provisions Regulations was upheld by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 228 CLR 566 at [23] [28]. 30 The Transitional Provisions Regulations were made pursuant to s 40 and s 42 of the 1992 Reform Act (see the discussion in Nystrom at [26]). Relevantly, s 40(5) and s 40(6), provided: (5) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, visas or permits in a specified Principal Act class and held by specified persons immediately before that date are to continue in effect as visas in a specified amended Act class. (6) The regulations may provide that, from 1 September 1994, specified persons are to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified amended Act class. Paragraph 42 of the explanatory memorandum to the 1992 Reform Bill provides an explanation as to the anticipated effect of s 40(5) and s 40(6): The clause [i.e. the relevant clause of the Migration Reform Bill 1992 which introduced proposed s 40(5) and s 40(6)] also provides that regulations may continue in force visas or entry permits of specified classes which were held immediately before the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas. Related to this provision, the regulations may also deem specified persons to be taken to have been granted visas in a specified class created after the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas. 31 The import of s 40(5) and s 40(6) appears to be that the regulations made pursuant to those provisions may differentiate between visas or permits that are deemed to ""continue in effect"" as at 1 September 1994, and visas that have been deemed to have been ""granted"" to a person as at 1 September 1994. Indeed, and in contradistinction to reg 4.01, reg 9 of the Transitional Provisions Regulations provides that the holders of particular types of visas are deemed to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa on 1 September 1994. As reg 9 states: A non-citizen who, immediately before 1 September 1994, held an old visa of the kind known as: (a) an Authority to Return; or (b) a Return Endorsement; is taken, on 1 September 1994, to have been granted a transitional (permanent) visa permitting the holder: (c) to travel to and enter Australia within 3 years after each departure from Australia; and (d) to remain indefinitely in Australia. 32 An important element in the applicant's case was that the Minister's power to cancel under the then s 180A (now s 501) of the Principal Act was restricted to visas and entry permits that had been ""granted"" to persons (and not acquired by operation of law) and this manifested a deliberate choice. This proposition is said to be apparent from the temporal proximity between the enactment of the Offences and Undesirable Persons Act and the enactment of the 1992 Reform Act, which as noted earlier, created a distinction between visas that are taken to have been granted and visas that are deemed to continue in effect.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.044,0.015,0.941,0.926,6.212

Case435,Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236,"Support for the applicant's contention can be found in the decision in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236 at 246, where a Full Court observed that the power conferred on the Minister to cancel a visa under s 501 only applies to visas that have been granted to a person. Where a visa has been granted to a person, s 501F(3) operates so that any other visa held by that person is cancelled. On this basis, where an absorbed person visa is cancelled, a transitional (permanent) visa held by that person is also cancelled. However, the Full Court indicated that this process could not operate in reverse. It will be necessary to say something more about this judgment later in these reasons. 13 The applicant also submitted that he had not ""ceased to be an immigrant"" prior to 2 April 1984, and hence has never held an absorbed person visa as contemplated by s 34 of the Principal Act. If so, it was submitted, the applicant is not the holder of an absorbed person visa and is the holder of only one visa, a transitional (permanent) visa, which cannot be cancelled. 14 The Minister submitted that there is no basis for treating the word ""granted"" in s 501(2) as limiting the cancellation power in the way submitted by the applicant. ""Granted"", in the context of s 501(2), encompasses any means by which a person is given or acquires a visa. The word ""granted"", as it appears in s 501(2), should be read as encompassing any means of giving under the law, including giving by statute as well as giving by administrative decision. Indeed, the purpose of the language in question (""granted to a person""), it was submitted, is to distinguish s 501(2), which concerns the cancellation of visas that are already in effect, from s 501(1), which concerns a refusal to grant visas on character grounds. For the purposes of s 501(2), what is significant is that the person has a visa and not the means by which that visa was acquired. 34 It is necessary to say something more about the Full Court judgment in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The observations of the Full Court in [42]-[45] of their reasons entail a fairly unequivocal statement that a power to cancel a visa ""that has been granted"" would not be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa because that type of visa had not been ""granted"" or could not be taken to have been granted. However these observations do not, in my opinion, form part of the ratio of the decision. The observations were made in a passage in which the Full Court was discussing ground one in the appeal. At [39], the Full Court indicated that two questions arose in the consideration of ground one. The first was whether the appellant could be taken to have been granted an absorbed person visa (which depended on whether he had been absorbed into the Australian community). The second was if he had not obtained an absorbed person visa, had the Minister effectively cancelled his transitional (permanent) visa. At [60] the Full Court concluded that the appellant had been absorbed into the Australian community well before to April 1984. The Full Court then concluded that the appellant held an absorbed person visa which was taken to have been granted to him. In the result, it was a visa which had been ""granted"" and one the Minister was empowered to cancel. It does not appear to me that this chain of reasoning necessarily depended on a conclusion that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa which had not been granted. 35 Nonetheless, even though these observations do not form part of the ratio of the decision in Moore , it is necessary for me, as a single judge, to give them significant weight. However, I am firmly convinced that the power to cancel conferred by s 501 was intended to be exercisable in relation to a transitional (permanent) visa. In this case, the applicant held such a visa because he had been originally granted an entry permit. When s 180A was enacted in 1992, the applicant held an entry permit that had been granted. That permit could have been cancelled by exercise of the power conferred by s 180A. The removal of the reference to a power to cancel ""a valid entry permit that had been granted"" occurred at a time when, by the combined effect of legislative amendments and the promulgation of regulations, visas became the sole means of conferring a right to remain lawfully in Australia. 36 It is inconceivable, in my view, that the amendments made in 1994 to s 180A were intended to render immune from the power to cancel, an entry permit which had been transmogrified into a transitional (permanent) visa. The power conferred by what was then the renumbered s 501 was plainly intended to authorise the Minister to cancel whatever visa was held by a person who the Minister thought ought no longer be able to remain in Australia having regard to that person's character. Obviously I am not concerned here with the appropriateness of the underlying policy or the way in which the power has been exercised in this or any other case. However, I have no doubt the power is intended to be exercisable in relation to any visa and the words ""that has been granted"" were not intended to condition or limit the power. These words remained as the truncated residue of the formulation first appearing in s 180A, namely ""a valid visa or a valid entry permit that has been granted"". 37 In my opinion, the Minister had power to cancel the applicant's transitional (permanent) visa. I order that the period within which the applicant is to file his application be extended, and the application be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.

It can safely be assumed that the Parliament intended that the powers of the Family Court should be wide enough to prevent either of the parties to a marriage from evading his or her obligations to the other party, but it does not follow that the Parliament intended that the legitimate interests of third parties should be subordinated to the interests of a party to a marriage, or that the Family Court should be able to make orders that would operate to the detriment of third parties. There is nothing in the words of the sections that suggests that the Family Court is intended to have power to defeat or prejudice the rights, or nullify the powers, of third parties, or to require them to perform duties which they were not previously liable to perform. It is one thing to order a party to a marriage to do whatever is within his power to comply with an order of the court, even if what he does may have some effect on the position of third parties, but it is quite another to order third parties to do what they are not legally bound to do.'",Criminal Case,Rape,0.13,0.031,0.839,0.9788,6.3268

Apart from any constitutional limitation, it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters.

Ltd. v. Harper .' The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and, in particular, it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain (1988) 20 FCR 507.

The Family Court, in the pursuit of its duty (in an appropriate case) to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage, has no power to deprive other parties of their rights.

Case439,Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131,"Thirdly, (in terms of the position before the Amending Act) s 35A of the Bankruptcy Act has been in the Act since 1988 and the above principles did not mean that this Court would never exercise its discretion to transfer proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court. The circumstances of the case might suggest that that course was appropriate even though, once transferred, the Family Court was bound to give full force and effect to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act : Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien (1995) 60 FCR 131. I also refer to Re Boscolo; Ex parte Botany Council (1996) 62 FCR 397 as an example of a case where this Court refused to transfer proceedings to the Family Court. 26 Had this application been made under the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the Amending Act, I would have seen no reason to transfer the proceedings to the Family Court. It is true that the Family Court would have had jurisdiction to hear the trustee's claim by reason of the order for transfer and the provisions of s 35A, but the Family Court would have had no power to make orders altering the ownership interests in the freehold property, leasehold property and speedboat if and once the trustee had brought the transfers within the provisions of s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act . If he was unsuccessful in doing that then the ownership interests would remain as they are. Furthermore, there is no existing order of the Family Court that might suggest, as it did in Re Sabri; Ex parte Sabri v Brien , that to avoid the appearance of conflict between orders, the proceedings should be transferred to the Family Court. 27 For the purposes of this case, the important change introduced by the Amending Act is that it gives the Family Court the power to make such orders as it considers appropriate, altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in what is referred to as 'the vested bankruptcy property'. It is necessary to examine the amendments in some detail because, as the submissions developed, counsel for Mrs Edge submitted that in pursuing a matrimonial cause the trustee 'had simply issued in the wrong court'. 28 The starting point is the introduction into the Family Law Act of two new paragraphs in the definition of 'matrimonial cause'. For present purposes, paragraph (cb) is the relevant paragraph and it is in the following terms: '(cb) proceedings between: (i) a party to a marriage; (ii) the bankruptcy trustee of a bankrupt party to the marriage; with respect to any vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party, being proceedings: (iii) arising out of the marital relationship; or (iv) in relation to concurrent, pending or completed divorce or validity of marriage proceedings between the parties to the marriage; or (v) in relation to the divorce of the parties to the marriage, the annulment of the marriage or the legal separation of the parties to the marriage, being a divorce, annulment or legal separation effected in accordance with the law of an overseas jurisdiction, where that divorce, annulment or legal separation is recognised as valid in Australia under section 104 ;' 29 The term 'vested bankruptcy property' is defined in s 4 of the Family Law Act as follows: '""vested bankruptcy property"" , in relation to a bankrupt, means property of the bankrupt that has vested in the bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 . For this purpose, property has the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 .' 30 By reason of the Amending Act, s 79(1) of the Family Law Act (which is in Part VIII) now reads: '(1) In property settlement proceedings, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate: (a) in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property; or (b) in the case of proceedings with respect to the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage--altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property; including: (c) an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property; and (d) an order requiring: (i) either or both of the parties to the marriage; or (ii) the relevant bankruptcy trustee (if any); to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the marriage or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.'",Criminal Case,Rape,0.13,0.053,0.818,0.9953,6.409549999999999
Case440,The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185,"On 18 May 2006, Mrs Edge issued proceedings in the Family Court of Australia against the trustee and the bankrupt seeking certain orders under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Family Law Act ').

That pursuant to section 78 of the Family Law Act 1975 a declaration be made that: 2.1 Pursuant to section 90KA of the Family Law Act 1975 , the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 is valid and binding, and 2.2 The transfers executed on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively pursuant to the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 are valid and binding. 2.3 In the alternative to 2.2, that the transfers effected on 18 and 19 September 2002 respectively were in contemplation of the Binding Financial Agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003 and thus valid and binding. 2.4 As a consequence thereof the wife is entitled to be and remain registered as the sole proprietor both at law and in equity of the properties situate at and known as 68 Range Road North, Upper Hermitage in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5711 Folio 494 and 32 &amp; 33 Pelican Point, Morgan in the State of South Australia being all the land comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 5203 folio 799. 3. In the alternative, that if the Transfers referred to in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 above are void against the first respondent by reason of the operation of either or both of sections 120 and 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 : - 3.1 An order pursuant to sub-sections 90K(1)(b) and (c) of the Family Law Act terminating the binding financial agreement entered into between the husband and wife on 22 May 2003. 3.2 Such order as is just and equitable pursuant to section 90K(3) of the Family Law Act 1975 preserving or adjusting the rights of the wife in relation to the property the subject of the terminated binding financial agreement. 4 In the further alternative to 2 and 3, that pursuant to section 79 of the Family Law Act 1975 , the net matrimonial assets of the parties be divided as to 75% to the applicant wife and 25% to the respondent husband. 5 That the husband's Trustee in Bankruptcy PETER IVAN MACKS be substituted as the Respondent in these proceedings in respect of the husband's property that may vest in the Trustee in Bankruptcy.' 15 The trustee submits that, insofar as an order is sought under s 79(1) of the Family Law Act , the application is out of time, and it will be necessary for Mrs Edge to obtain an extension of time. I have no information before me as to whether an extension of time will be granted, and I think it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that it may be granted. 16 Significant amendments were made to the Bankruptcy Act and Family Law Act by the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (Cth). I will refer to this Act as 'the Amending Act'. In terms of the issues in this case, it was not suggested that the relevant provisions of the Amending Act did not apply by reason of the fact that the relevant provisions came into effect during the course of 2005. I note that the amendments in Schedule 1 came into operation on 18 September 2005, those in Schedule 2 on 18 March 2005 and the balance on 15 April 2005. 17 In order to explain the effect of the Amending Act on the legal rights and interests between a non-bankrupt spouse and the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt spouse, it is necessary to briefly examine the position before that Act. For present purposes, the previous position may be summarised as follows. 18 First, s 120(2) excludes from the operation of subsection (1) (among other things) a transfer to meet all or part of a liability under a maintenance agreement. Before 15 April 2005, 'maintenance agreement' was defined to include a financial agreement within the meaning of the Family Law Act . A similar exclusion or exception applied in relation to other provisions in the Bankruptcy Act , but it was not an exclusion or exception in the case of the operation of s 121 where the main purpose of the transfer was to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor's creditors or to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor's creditors (s 123(6)). Before the introduction of the Amending Act, Mrs Edge could have raised as a defence or exception to the trustee's claim under s 120, but not s 121, an allegation that the transfers were to meet liabilities under a financial agreement. 23 In The Queen v Ross-Jones; Ex parte Green [1984] HCA 82 ; (1984) 156 CLR 185, Wilson and Dawson JJ said (at 211) (footnotes omitted): 'We should add that even if those proceedings were a matrimonial cause, the Family Court would nevertheless lack the power to grant the relief sought. Apart from any constitutional limitation, it is now authoritatively established that as a matter of construction the general powers of the Family Court are to be understood in the context of the Family Law Act which confers jurisdiction upon the Court in matrimonial causes and associated matters. Those powers, which include the power to grant injunctive relief under s. 114 , are not to be construed so as to confer jurisdiction to defeat the rights, or enlarge the obligations, of persons who are not parties to the marriage involved in the relevant matrimonial cause: Ascot Investments Pty. Ltd. v. Harper .' The principle referred to in the above passages has been applied in a number of cases in this Court and, in particular, it was applied in a context involving the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Swain (1988) 20 FCR 507. Davies, Lockhart and Burchett JJ said (at 514): 'A sequestration order reflects a right of a creditor, and creates rights as between a debtor and his creditors and trustee. The Family Court, in the pursuit of its duty (in an appropriate case) to adjust rights as between the parties to a marriage, has no power to deprive other parties of their rights. Its power to deal with the property of the parties over whom it has jurisdiction must start with the property that is theirs, not with property that the law (whether the Bankruptcy Act or some other law) has vested in another.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.074,0.025,0.901,0.9932,6.427200000000001
Case441,Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZKKC (2007) 159 FCR 565,"However, the decision of Scarlett FM was handed down before the decision of a Full Federal Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZKKC (2007) 159 FCR 565. That case is authority for the proposition that s 477 of the Act requires actual notification of the written statement required by s 430(1). Buchanan J, with whom Gyles J and I agreed, said at [37] that the sole method of actual notification is physical delivery by hand. 5 His Honour also said at [47] that: ""Before their [i.e. the applicants'] right to apply for judicial review of a decision of the RRT which is alleged to be beyond jurisdiction is extinguished it will be necessary for the periods of time prescribed by s 477 to pass after an applicant is given personally the written statement required by s 430(1) of the Act..."" 6 Justice Gyles, at [1] and [4], pointed to the serious practical difficulties which flow from the reasons of the Full Court. 7 The decision in SZKKC is now the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. However, plainly enough, I am bound by the decision of the Full Court unless and until it is overturned by the High Court. 8 The Minister, in his written submissions, pointed to a number of discretionary considerations as to why I ought not to grant leave to appeal. Mr Chami also pointed to the fact that ordinarily presumptions would be raised against the applicant on the question of receipt of the reasons of the Tribunal. However, it seems to me that none of the matters to which reference is made in the Minister's submissions go to the question which was before Scarlett FM as to whether the Federal Magistrates Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for judicial review. 9 In light of the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC there can be no real argument but that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal. There would, of course, be an injustice to the applicant if leave were denied because he would be shut out from a substantive hearing of his application for review. 10 It follows that I propose to grant leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM. Moreover, it seems to me that the practical course is to allow the appeal because the matter cannot be distinguished from the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC . 11 After some debate, Mr Chami accepted the inevitability of this outcome and did not really oppose an order that the appeal be allowed because the effect of this will be that the matter is to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing of the application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 12 In his reasons for judgment Scarlett FM drew attention to the delays in this matter. He expressed the view that the delays on the part of the Minister's Department are ""nothing short of astonishing"". Whether or not this is so, it does seem to me that this is a case which calls out for an urgent hearing. I would therefore make the following orders: (1) Leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM of 18 June 2007 be granted. (2) The appeal be heard instanter. (3) The appeal be allowed, to the intent that the decision of Scarlett FM that the application be dismissed as incompetent is to be set aside. (4) The order made by Scarlett FM on 18 June 2007 be set aside. (5) The application in this matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.056,0.045,0.899,0.2173,3.74955

Case445,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626,"The ""public interest"" claimed by the ACCC to require protection of Category III documents from disclosure was said to be to encourage, by ensuring the confidentiality of information they provide, cartel whistleblowers to come forward. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [43] , the Court suggested in obiter dicta that such a public interest might exist. In the present case, Counsel for the ACCC put it this way: The public interest ... is to induce the Amcors of this world - those who come forward early, under the immunity policy - to give the fullest possible assistance to the [ACCC] to ensure that the cartel is put at an end as quickly as possible, prosecuted, and brought to finality quickly. The more assistance that Amcor gives the [ACCC] in that regard, the better the quality of the admissions and the evidence ... 28 Counsel for the ACCC conceded that confidentiality could not be absolute, in that both the ACCC and any potential whistleblower should reasonably expect that the whistleblower might have to testify in open court (ie, the whistleblower's statements might ultimately come into the public domain). Nevertheless, counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that: (1) it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court; and (2) the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule. Without being able to rely on the confidentiality of statements not used in court, counsel for the ACCC submitted that whistleblowers might be dissuaded from coming forward and the public interest in rooting out cartel conduct correspondingly injured. 29 Regardless of whatever theoretical merit the argument may have (which I will address shortly), the force of the ACCC's submission was undercut by the evidence of its own witness Mr Cassidy (the officer in charge of the leniency program for cartel whistleblowers) that in the present case Amcor did not seek confidentiality guarantees in its immunity application. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [44] , the Court suggested that the force of any public interest immunity claim will be vitiated where the independent witnesses cooperating with the ACCC did not even seek confidentiality. I agree. Moreover, even the broader factual merit of the claim is suspect, as the ACCC led no evidence that any cartel whistleblower, whether in this case or otherwise, has demonstrated reluctance to come forward based on a concern that information provided might become public. 30 The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.091,0.033,0.876,0.9876,6.3986

Visy has been joined by Amcor as a respondent to Amcor's cross claim in the damages proceedings. 2 An interlocutory dispute has arisen in the damages proceedings.

Case451,Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958,"On the other hand, there is also authority for the proposition that filing and service, without more, operates as a full or limited waiver: eg, Complete Technology Pty Ltd v Toshiba (Australia) Pty Ltd (1994) 53 FCR 125; Austress v Marlin [2002] NSWSC 958 ; Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Neate (1998) 144 FLR 373; Black &amp; Decker Inc v Flymo Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 753; In the Marriage of Crowe [1988] FLC 91-983 and Leaders Shoes (Aust) Pty Ltd v National Insurance Co of New Zealand Ltd [1968] 1 NSWR 344. As one would expect, Cadbury relies on these cases. Cadbury also relies on Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283, where the Full Court of the Federal Court considered this conflicting authority. Although the Full Court did not formally decide the issue, it did suggest that the proper approach must recognize the distinction between legal professional privilege and the implied undertaking (with respect to the implied undertaking, see [19-22] below). The Full Court's criticism of the Smoothdale line of cases (at [25]) was in the following terms: The difficulty with the approach in Smoothdale is highlighted by the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958 in which his Honour distinguished cases such as Smoothdale on the basis that they were concerned with use in one proceedings of a statement or an affidavit filed and served in another. Barrett J, on the other hand, was dealing with the question whether a party could tender, as an admission, parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party in the same proceeding. Barrett J said, buttressed by ample authority, that this could be done, because it was within the range of permitted use the purpose of the proceedings. Barrett J was undoubtedly correct. Thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in Austress ) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents.

Case455,Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501,"With respect to advice privilege it was, until recently, uncontroversial that the proponent had to establish three elements: (1) a confidential communication, (2) between a lawyer and client, (3) made for the dominant purpose of giving or receiving legal advice: see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501, 508-09 (stating that a confidential lawyer-client relationship is required) and Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [61] (adopting the dominant purpose test). The Full Court of the Federal Court has now dispensed with the second requirement, holding that third-party communications may come within the ambit of advice privilege: Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [49] , and [105]. 9 However, the witnesses whose statements are at issue here had no express agreement or arrangement relating to confidentiality at the time the statements were made. Indeed, the ACCC's own witness in the present application confirmed that Amcor made no attempt to seek confidentiality: see [28] below. And it was not suggested that any implied agreement relating to confidentiality of communications between any of the witnesses and the investigators can be identified. It follows that advice privilege cannot attach to communications between the witnesses and investigators. And it also follows that no advice privilege inherently attaches to any documents (ie, the witness statements) summarizing those communications (which is not to say that privilege could never attach to copies or summaries of the communications depending on the purpose for which the copies or summaries were created: see Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501). Accordingly, a claim of advice privilege fails with respect to all three categories of disputed documents. 11 It is at this point that the doctrinal relationship between the advice and litigation branches of the privilege becomes relevant. As McLure JA noted in Leighton , the "" High Court has made numerous general statements which, on their face, are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege, to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications "": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [22] . In fact, some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege. For example, in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (at 508-09), Mason J stated in O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria [1982] HCA 74 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 22-23: But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation. Be that as it may, I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue, leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views. 33 Second, the ""free rider"" argument fails because it is, ultimately, founded on a theory of ""work product"" privilege not accepted in Australia. The work product doctrine, recognized by the United States Supreme Court, states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions, strategy, or other ""work product,"" even though not documenting lawyer-client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege, may be independently protected from discovery: Hickman v Taylor (1947) 329 US 495. The problem for the ACCC, however, is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege: Commissioner of Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 570 (describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia) (Gummow J); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [17] (stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege). The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, ""Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct"" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616&amp;nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5&amp;fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 37 For the sake of completeness, I should first note Cadbury's overall argument regarding the Category I documents. It was based on the fact that the copy witness statements retained by Amcor were just that - copies - and thus under Propend , their privilege status may differ from that of the original. To the extent that I have correctly understood the argument put by counsel, it misunderstands Propend . Propend established that the copy of a document may under some circumstances (ie depending on the dominant purpose for which it was created) be privileged even though the original is not privileged: Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 508 per Brennan CJ, 543-544 per Gaudron J, and 554 per McHugh J. I do not, however, consider that Propend also establishes the converse; that is, the copy of a document may be unprivileged even though the original is. 38 Instead, I understand Propend to say that a copy of a privileged document will also be privileged unless the privilege has been expressly or impliedly waived (although it may be that allowing a copy to be made in certain circumstances is capable of being conduct constituting such a waiver, such as when a copy is made and communicated to a third party for purposes not related to legal advice or litigation): cf Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 201 at [60] - [66] (noting that Propend left the issue open but concluding that whether a copy of a privileged document is privileged is distinct from whether privilege has been waived). As such, Cadbury's argument, notwithstanding the way in which counsel sought to frame it, may be reduced to two questions: (1) are the documents privileged; and (2) has privilege been waived? 43 Against that background, I now turn to the question of waiver. Cadbury correctly notes that there is no evidence as to how or why copies of Category I documents were made and retained by Amcor or Amcor's external solicitors. As noted earlier, Cadbury agitated this argument as a reverse Propend claim. It is, however, more properly understood as a waiver claim. That is to say, Cadbury appears to argue that although the original documents may have been created by or provided to Amcor under circumstances of confidentiality and even express claims of privilege, allowing Amcor to make or retain copies for its own use is conduct by ACCC inconsistent with its privilege claim.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.123,0.053,0.824,0.9975,6.421250000000001

It is vital because the implied undertaking is not absolute but the privilege is. The Plowman Court in dicta stated (at 33): No doubt the implied obligation must yield to inconsistent statutory provisions and to the requirements of curial process in other litigation, eg, discovery and inspection, but that circumstance is not a reason for denying the existence of the implied obligation.

Barrett J, on the other hand, was dealing with the question whether a party could tender, as an admission, parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party in the same proceeding. Barrett J said, buttressed by ample authority, that this could be done, because it was within the range of permitted use the purpose of the proceedings. Barrett J was undoubtedly correct. Thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in Austress ) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents.

The decision in Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283 was a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court. The reasoning, if I may say so, is both persuasive and sensible. If it is conceded, as it must be, that a party upon whom a witness statement is served may use that statement in any way within the context of those proceedings (that is the whole reason why it is filed and served), it follows that it is conduct ""inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect "" ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] ) and an implied waiver of privilege has occurred. Indeed, if one follows the Full Court's reasoning to its logical conclusion, the filing and service operates as a complete, not simply limited, waiver of legal privilege. 21 A basic principle of Australian litigation is that parties give an implied undertaking to the court not to use any document produced to them in the course of litigation except in the context of that litigation: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10, 32, 36-37, 46; see also Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280. Where other courts have erred doctrinally is in failing to distinguish the implied undertaking analysis from the waiver analysis. The Full Court in Liberty Funding recognized this error when it stated (at [26]): "" This so-called 'limited waiver' by service such that the privilege is waived only for the purpose of the legal proceedings in question might be seen to be no more than the operation of the implied undertaking dealt with in Harman "": Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283. In other words, the limitation on Visy's use of the witness proofs stems not from limitations to be inferred from the conduct of the ACCC in serving them, but in Visy's own obligations to the Court. 23 Moreover, even if the implied undertaking does not automatically give way, a party may still be released from it in the court's discretion upon showing ""special circumstances"": Liberty Funding (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [31]. Although Cadbury anticipated the implied undertaking issue in its written submissions in these proceedings, the ACCC did not address the implied undertaking in its submissions, nor was the issue fully ventilated in oral submissions by any party . Accordingly, the parties in the damages proceeding and the ACCC will be invited, though not required, to make further written and oral submissions about whether Visy's implied undertaking in the ACCC proceedings prevents Visy producing the Category II and Category III documents and, if the implied undertaking is not overridden, whether Visy should be released from it. 24 I now turn to the ACCC's separate claim of public interest immunity with respect to 8 of the 111 witness proofs, the Category III documents.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.111,0.038,0.851,0.9981,6.42035

So, for example, providing a witness statement to a party but subject to conditions that the party may use it only for internal purposes, may not read it in court, may not place it into evidence and may not otherwise rely on it in examination or the proceedings generally might constitute a limited waiver only: see Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83, 96 (stating that the waiver ""can be limited so that it applies only in relation to particular persons, materials or purposes"" ); Goldman v Hesper [1988] 3 All ER 97 (cited in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1988) 201 CLR 1 at [29] for the proposition that disclosure ""for a limited and specific purpose"" will not lead to loss of the privilege).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.107,0.014,0.878,0.9954,6.3879

Be that as it may, I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue, leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views. 31 That the speculation regarding witness reluctance is likely to be unfounded is further supported by the fact, acknowledged by counsel for the ACCC, that even if production of the Category III documents were barred, Cadbury would be free to undertake its own investigation. As noted by McLure JA in Leighton , "" Privilege in respect of [the disputed] communications would not prevent the respondent interviewing [third-party] witnesses and obtaining all relevant information from them concerning the issues in the litigation "": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [31] . It is perhaps, therefore, unsurprising that counsel for the ACCC ultimately fell back on a ""free rider"" argument - that is, that Cadbury should not have the benefit of the ACCC's work precisely because it could easily do the work itself. This argument fails for two reasons. 33 Second, the ""free rider"" argument fails because it is, ultimately, founded on a theory of ""work product"" privilege not accepted in Australia. The work product doctrine, recognized by the United States Supreme Court, states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions, strategy, or other ""work product,"" even though not documenting lawyer-client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege, may be independently protected from discovery: Hickman v Taylor (1947) 329 US 495. The problem for the ACCC, however, is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege: Commissioner of Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 570 (describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia) (Gummow J); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [17] (stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege). The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, ""Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct"" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616&amp;nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5&amp;fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 40 In Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244, 246, Lockhart J described the litigation privilege rule as follows: Communications passing between the party and a third person (who is not the agent of the solicitor to receive the communication from the party) if they are made with reference to litigation either anticipated or commenced, and at the request or suggestion of the party's solicitor; or, even without any such request or suggestion, they are made for the purpose of being put before the solicitor with the object of obtaining his advice or enabling him to prosecute or defend an action. See also ACCC v FFE Building Services [2003] ATPR 41-967 at [24]-[33]; Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [12] ; Pratt Holdings [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [1] , [89] and [96]. 44 In this regard, Amcor's solicitor Mr Meadows testified that his firm, Allens Arthur Robinson, was "" permitted to advise Amcor [based on knowledge it obtained in witness interviews summarized in the documents now at issue] subject to any confidentiality constraints that had been agreed ."" He added that the firm's copies were not being retained "" for the ACCC ."" Thus the argument might go that while Amcor may have been (and may still be) under some equitable or quasi-contractual obligation of confidentiality (ie it may not be free to simply distribute the documents as it sees fit), that cannot override the obligations of compulsory court process in this case: see Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [28] (stating that contractual or equitable duties cannot prevail over compulsory court process). 45 To restate the question, it comes down to this: did the ACCC, in allowing Amcor via its solicitors to make and retain copies of the Category I documents, engage in conduct impliedly waiving its privilege? To answer the question, I return to the analysis employed earlier at [15]-[18]. In contrast to the Category II and III documents, with respect to which the ACCC ceded complete control over disclosure to Visy by filing and serving the documents, the evidence with respect to Category I was that the use to which Amcor's solicitors could put the documents was limited to one purpose and one purpose only: advising the client. Indeed, as noted earlier, the three documents drafted by Amcor's solicitors could not even be shown to Amcor. The disclosure to Amcor was for a ""limited and specific purpose"" (advice to the client) and ""applies only in relation to particular persons and materials"" . Amcor employees were the particular persons. The materials were the communications and documents recording them. The ACCC's conduct in allowing copies of the documents to be made and retained constitutes only a limited waiver: see [18] above. It follows that the Category I documents are barred from production to Cadbury. 46 Strictly speaking, I need go no further. However, I think it appropriate before concluding to make a general observation about the ACCC's overall interest in this case and whether the courts are the appropriate forum for its resolution. The ACCC's submissions and the evidence from its witnesses demonstrated a concern that the increasing threat of private suits for damages brought by cartel victims will interfere with the ACCC's ability to obtain the cooperation from cartel participants necessary for it to bring and prosecute penalty actions. The interference was said to arise because potential cooperators will be deterred from coming forward, notwithstanding offers of leniency, by the prospect of having essentially given away the store in the inevitable damages actions. In other words, in considering whether to confess, the potential costs in damages may be seen by a cartel player to outweigh the potential savings in penalties. Distilling the point still further, one can see that the real concern of the ACCC - that is, the real deterrent to cooperation faced by the Amcors of the world - is damages exposure itself. In my view, the confidentiality and free-rider arguments ostensibly advanced here by the ACCC are, at best, a proxy for that concern, and at worst a smokescreen obscuring it. To be fair, the appropriate total level of private civil liability (ie, penalties plus damages) an actor should face for cartel conduct is a valid issue, and one which was long ago recognized by authorities and commentators in the United States in the context of cooperation and leniency: see eg, Giancarlo Spagnolo, ""Leniency and Whistleblowers in Antitrust,"" Centre for Economic Policy Research Discussion Paper Series No. 5794 (August 2006) at 15, available at http://www.cepr.org/pubs/dps/DP5794.asp (visited 11 February 2008). 47 But to acknowledge the ACCC's concern is not to approve of its proposed method for resolving that concern. On the contrary, the ACCC's attempt to use common law privilege doctrine to protect cooperators when they are faced with private suits for damages, albeit partially successful here, appears to me to be misguided. Whether cartel whistleblowers such as Amcor or those who cooperate with the regulators after the commencement of penalty proceedings (either by settling like Visy or in some other manner) should be rewarded or encouraged by reduced exposure or enhanced protection in damages proceedings is a broad question of policy that should be addressed by the legislature, not by ad hoc judicial tinkering through the backdoor of privilege. 48 The parties and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may, if they wish, file and serve written submissions of not more than 10 pages as to: (1) whether Visy is still bound not to produce the Category II and Category III documents by its implied undertaking in the ACCC proceedings; and (2) if so, whether special circumstances exist such that the Court in its discretion ought to release Visy from that undertaking. The matter will be set down for further hearing, if necessary, at a date to be fixed in consultation with the parties. I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.

Case487,Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd [1997] 38 IPR 539,"The key principle assisting the Court in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act is whether the judgment was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered and accordingly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused: Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd [1997] 38 IPR 539 at 542. 11 In Court this afternoon the applicant clarified the first paragraph in his affidavit as being referable to the fact that the respondent had filed Ms Genz's affidavit after the date ordered by Jarrett FM on 13 March 2008, rather than the fact that the respondent had not actually filed a defence. In relation to this point I note in passing that there is no general requirement to file a defence in such matters before the Federal Magistrates Court. Part 4 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules allows the respondent to file a response (r 4.04) which must be filed and served within 14 days after the service of the application, and an affidavit must be filed with the response (r 4.05). I understand that the respondent filed a response and supporting affidavit on 24 December 2007. 12 In this case I am unable to see that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered, or that substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused to the applicant. 13 First, in my view, paras 2, 3 and 4 deposed by the applicant in his affidavit of 30 May 2008 have little merit as grounds for leave to appeal. I make this observation because, dealing with each factor in turn: &#8226; the reference by the applicant to the respondent failing to comply with O 15 in para 2 is unclear; &#8226; what appear to be minimal irregularities to Ms Genz's affidavit in relation to the date it was sworn, while undesirable without proper attestation, nonetheless do not support an adjournment of the substantive hearing in these proceedings; and &#8226; I understand from the submissions of Mr Hooper for the respondent that the firm of lawyers earlier representing the respondent merged with another firm but that the resultant merged firm continued to act for the respondent. Part 9 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules deals with lawyers, and in particular r 9.02 which deals with change of lawyers. It is not clear to me how the applicant is affected, or has been affected, by the respondent changing its lawyer. The fact that a solicitor from the newly merged firm may have contacted him contrary to an arrangement that there be no telephone contact between the parties does not in my view form a reason of any substance for his Honour refusing to adjourn the substantive hearing. 14 Second, I am not persuaded that the applicant would suffer substantial injustice should leave to appeal be refused. The principal issue raised by the applicant, namely the fact that the respondent served an affidavit several days late and with a page missing, was addressed by his Honour during the hearing on 29 May 2008. Although the applicant indicated at that hearing that the lateness and incompleteness of the affidavit would prejudice him in preparation of his case for the hearing, including calling witnesses, I do not see how the applicant has suffered more than some inconvenience. The applicant has commenced these proceedings - it is his responsibility to prosecute his case. This includes organisation of evidence for the trial, and filing and serving affidavits of witnesses upon whose evidence the applicant wishes to rely at trial. I note that, according to the Federal Magistrates Court file, the only witness upon whose evidence the applicant is currently relying is himself and yet if the applicant wished to rely on the evidence of other witnesses it would have been incumbent on him to file and serve affidavits of those witnesses in accordance with the timetable ordered by the Federal Magistrate. Indeed, the applicant would be in breach of the orders of Jarrett FM were he to produce at trial witnesses whose evidence was not previously filed and served. While the applicant has a number of complaints about the lack of cooperation of the respondent and his resultant inability to contact potential witnesses to give evidence in support of his application, this is not in my view relevant to the application currently before me. 15 Further, the applicant claims that he has not been given sufficient time to prepare his case for trial. However these proceedings have been on foot since December 2007. The applicant today raised the need to care for his son as an issue which impacts upon his ability to prepare for trial. While I consider this to be a very real issue, there is no evidence before me that this has ever been raised before Jarrett FM as an issue relevant to the timing of the trial; nor does it relate in my view to the issue of lateness of service and incompleteness of Ms Genz's affidavit which forms the basis of the primary submissions of the applicant in this case. 16 The applicant has indicated that he is not ready for trial tomorrow. However the decision for me, in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal, is whether the judgment of Jarrett FM refusing to adjourn the hearing of the substantive proceedings is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration. In my view it is not. The appropriate order is that leave to appeal be refused, and I so order. I will also order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of today's proceedings, to be taxed if not otherwise agreed. I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

Case488,Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171,"helpful and reflective summary of principle in relation to the reception of expert evidence having regard to the Uniform Evidence Act (of which the Evidence Act is an exemplar), is to be found in the judgment of Allsop J, as his Honour then was, in Evans Deakin Proprietary Limited v Sebel Furniture Limited [2003] FCA 171 at [670] . His Honour there observed: Central to the orderly and admissible presentation of any expert evidence is the clear identification of the opinions that the expert seeks to present. This is a separate question from whether, for the opinions of the expert to be admissible, the basis of the opinions on the assumed facts must be set out, about which there may be different views expressed in Makita and Quick v Stoland . I think, however, any such difference is unlikely, in most cases, to be of significance in the light, in particular, of s 135 of the Evidence Act and its likely application to disembodied and unsubstantiated expressions of opinion, a matter to which reference was made in Quick v Stoland . If I may say so, without intending to put to one side the comprehensive reasons of Heydon JA in Makita or the careful reasons of the Judges in Quick v Stoland, in this case I particularly bear in mind what Gleeson CJ said in HG v The Queen at 727: ""The opinions of Mr McCombie were never expressed in admissible form."" And then his Honour emphasised this: An expert whose opinion is sought to be tendered should differentiate between the assumed facts upon which the opinion is based, and the opinion in question. Then a little later: Argument in this Court proceeded on the basis that it was possible to identify from Mr McCombie's written report some facts which he either observed or accepted, and which could be distinguished from his expressions of expert opinion. Then again Allsop J emphasised this in Gleeson CJ's reasons in HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2 at [39] : Even so, the provisions of section 79 will often have the practical effect of emphasising the need for attention to requirements of form. By directing attention to whether an opinion is wholly or substantially based on specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience, the section requires that the opinion is presented in a form which makes it possible to answer that question. This particular passage goes to the second basis upon which objection is taken to Mr Tait's opinion, which is that it is non-compliant with the requirements of the exception to the opinion rule, found in s 79 of the Evidence Act . Though initially, on the face of the report itself, I was apprehensive as to whether Mr Tait had exposed any particular expertise in relation to fish ecology and biology as applied to lungfish, I am satisfied, having regard to his supplementation of his experience in the affidavit filed this morning by leave, that he does have experience in relation to the ecology and management issues associated with the passage of freshwater fish, including lungfish, over barriers. The difficulty is that his report, as I have observed, ranges much more widely than the issues on the pleadings. Further, insofar as section 4 in particular of the report is concerned, that appears to be but a mere collation, as opposed to, overtly, the views of someone experienced with lungfish enlarging upon, by reference to his own specialised knowledge, the views of others which he regards as correct and appropriately included by way of highlighting particular qualities of the lungfish. There is also the vice elsewhere evident in the report, insofar as it may be relevant, of not making plain what is fact and what is opinion.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.033,0.013,0.954,0.8552,5.9732

Case490,Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594,"Some decisions involving the application of s 40(1)(g) have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application. Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding, reliance in such cases is placed upon s 40(3) of the 1966 Act which relevantly provides as follows: For the purposes of paragraph (1)(g): ... (b) a judgment or order that is enforceable as, or in the same manner as, a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which, or in consequence of which, the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained; ... One such decision is Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393. An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property. That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance. The cross-claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property. That cross-claim or set-off, Fitzgerald J held, could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction. His Honour concluded (at 407 8): It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982 is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court. The order for costs is therefore deemed by s 40(3)(b) of the Act to be a ""final judgment so obtained"", that is, a ""final judgment"" obtained in an ""action"". However, s 40(3)(b) of the Act does not stop there; the ""action"" is identified. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g), the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the ""proceedings"" in which the order was in fact obtained into the ""action"" in which the notional ""final judgment"" was obtained. In my opinion, the test in such circumstances called for by s 40(1)(g) of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982, but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action, the proceeding in which the order for costs was made, that is, the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action. The answer is clearly negative. ... Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594. An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 (NSW) out of time. The application was dismissed with costs. A certificate of taxation issued and, subsequently, a bankruptcy notice. It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt. But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the "" proceeding "", that "" proceeding "" either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application. 34 In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the "" action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "". At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either: (i) the claim for declaratory relief, together with costs; or, more narrowly (ii) the claim for the costs order. An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the "" proceeding "" before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith . The narrower the identification of the "" proceeding "", the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer. A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that "" where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings, that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained (see s40(3)(b)) "". By the end of oral submissions, however, the Applicant contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was: (iii) the "" proceeding "" in the District Court whereby judgment was entered for the sum of money assessed in the Certificate of Determination of Costs .",Criminal Case,Rape,0.061,0.038,0.901,0.9764,6.394400000000001

Case492,Clark v UDC Finance Ltd [1985] 2 NZLR 636,"Consistent with the legislative objective sought to be achieved by s 40(1)(g) , it has been held that the phrase "" could not have been set up "" refers to a "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which could not have been set up as a matter of law; a mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

An Amended Notice of Motion was resolved by Acting Justice Bryson on 31 July 2008 when His Honour concluded in relevant part: [4] The order which the trial Judge made on that subject was, obviously in its terms, interlocutory; it is not a final order and could not be the source of any estoppel or res judicata. The order speaks extremely briefly of an account of profits, obviously in contemplation of further detailed directions about the taking of such an account and about what was to be done with the matter ascertained on taking the account. ... [6] An order for an account of profits, including the order made on 8 March 2007 which used ""such profits"" to refer back to the declaration previously made, on its ordinary and natural meaning and without any further exposition is an order for an account of losses if matter accounted for should have generated losses. If the Court had intended anything so strange as an account or enquiry limited only to profits, and to leave ascertainment of losses, if there should be any, to be neglected and not dealt with, there would have been a marked departure from the Court's statutory duty to resolve the whole controversy. If the order of 8 March 2007 had been intended to effect any [sic] so strange a result I am confident that it would say so in a highly explicit manner. 13 Those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of immediate relevance to the Application now before this Court are ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7). 14 Section 40(1)(g) of the 1966 Act provides as follows: Acts of bankruptcy (1) A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases: ...

A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate. Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows: [16] It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s 208J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation. The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court, having received the determination of the costs assessor, it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . The first option, it argued, was the option of filing the certificate issued under s 208J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained. The second option, it argued, was the option which it in fact adopted; that is, the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s 208J. The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor. Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded: [30] The submissions of the Council identified in [16] are, in my view, unsustainable. Section 40(1)(g) does not, as it seems to me, admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt, or perhaps more accurately, sourced from the same obligation. Further, s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution (Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 198 per Riley J). I incline to the view that Pt 44 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), as presently worded, does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed. It seems to me to be implicit in Pt 44, r 7, as presently worded, that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act . ... [32] I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded, and which is attached to it as required by Form 1, is not ""a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed"" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.088,0.03,0.882,0.986,6.393000000000001

Case499,In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431,"The present Bankruptcy Notice was served on 11 February 2008 requiring either payment or the making of an "" arrangement to the creditor's satisfaction for settlement of the debt "" within 21 days. Annexed to the Bankruptcy Notice was a Certificate of Judgment of the District Court certifying the recovery of judgment in that Court. 5 The Application was filed in this Court on 29 February 2008. That Application seeks an order setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice . The power of this Court to set aside a bankruptcy notice was not questioned: Re Sterling; Ex parte Esanda Ltd [1980] FCA 61 ; (1980) 30 ALR 77 at 83 per Lockhart J; Dimasi v Nangiloc Colignan Farms Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 308 at [25] , [2007] FCA 308 ; 239 ALR 330 at 337 per Ryan J. 6 In the present proceeding it is claimed that the Applicant has "" a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as referred to in s 40(1)(g) "" of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Section 41(7) of the 1966 Act has the effect that, upon that Application having been filed, the time for compliance with the Notice is deemed to have been extended until the Court determines the Application . 7 The "" counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand "" relied upon by the present Applicant is his right to set-off the losses incurred in respect to the development of the Merrylands property. These losses, it is accepted by the parties, exceed the judgment debt upon which the Bankruptcy Notice is founded. 8 That "" counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand "" is said by the Applicant to be one that he "" could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "" within the meaning of and for the purposes of s 40(1)(g). 9 The litigation in the Supreme Court dates back to 2004 when an Amended Statement of Claim was apparently filed seeking declaratory relief as to the arrangement between the parties in respect to the development property. To be resolved was whether the nature of any arrangement between the then Plaintiff and Defendant was simply one whereby work was performed in return for remuneration or whether the parties would each be entitled to a 50% share of profits on sale. 23 In In re Judd, Ex parte Pike, supra, Maughan AJ observed that the word "" counter-claim "" most probably refers to "" those claims which might be the subject of a counter-claim in equity ""; the term "" set-off "" was said to refer to "" those claims which might be the subject of a set-off at common law "". And the term "" cross demand "" was said to be "" not a technical term and must ... refer to claims other than those which would be comprised in the two expressions 'counter-claim' and 'set-off' "": (1924) 24 SR (NSW) 537 at 539. An "" unrestricted meaning "", it was said, was to be given to the word "" cross demand "" (at 540). The meaning of each of these terms was also explored in In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431. Declaratory relief sought in the Chancery Division as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property was held not to be a "" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand "". Lord Hanworth MR there observed that "" set-off "" was "" a word well known and established in its meaning "" (at 437). Of the term "" cross demand "" it was observed (at 438): I turn, therefore, to what to my mind is the wider word, ""cross-demand."" If a cross-demand is only to be interpreted as meaning something which could have been introduced into the action by way of counterclaim, it adds nothing to the word ""counterclaim."" ""Cross-demand"" seems to me to be a word introduced in order to give a wider ambit to the meaning of these claims, something that would not be described, certainly, as a set-off, something that could not have been brought in the action, something that still lies outside a counterclaim, but is of a nature which can be specified and which is of such a nature that it equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt. I do not desire to say what ""cross-demand"" may include, but it is not difficult to say that it does not include a claim of such uncertain nature as appears in these Chancery proceedings. That claim does not appear to be one which it would be proper to describe as a cross-demand; it is a claim of right which may inure ultimately for the benefit of the judgment debtor. Therefore, it appears that there is no sufficient ground for setting aside this bankruptcy notice; the bankruptcy notice stands good and must be complied with. Romer and Maugham LJJ delivered separate judgments but agreed with Lord Hanworth MR. 37 Attached to the Bankruptcy Notice as served upon the Applicant on 11 February 2008 was the judgment of the District Court, being the Certificate of Judgment signed by the Registrar of that Court. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g) , the "" action or proceeding "" in which that judgment was obtained was necessarily the District Court proceeding. "" A proceeding "", it may be noted, "" may mean something as distinct from an action or any step thereunder in which final orders are made for the payment of money. It may also mean a step in an action, in which proceeding a final order is made for the payment of money "": Re Black; Ex parte Jeffery (1932) 4 ABC 157 at 160 per Lukin J. 38 The judgment entered by that Court was entered as a consequence of the Certificate having been issued in respect to those costs which had been ordered to be paid by the Supreme Court and the subsequent filing of that Certificate by the Respondent with the District Court. There was no suggestion that that judgment had in fact been stayed. The Bankruptcy Notice as served stated that it had not been stayed. 39 The process whereby that judgment came to be entered by the District Court is regulated by the provisions of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) . 46 The result of the present Application, it is considered, can be stated simply. For the purposes of the present Application , it was accepted that the joint venture agreement as between the Applicant and the Respondent gave rise to losses, those losses being said to be approximately $160,000. Those losses obviously exceed the judgment debt of $77,498.96. But, as at the date upon which the Bankruptcy Notice was served in February 2008, no account had been taken -- as had been ordered by Hall J in March 2007. Whether an account had or had not been taken, however, those losses could not have been set up during the process whereby the costs assessor made a determination as to costs. Nor could those losses have been set up in opposition to the filing of the Certificate of the costs assessor with the District Court and the judgment thereafter being taken to have been made by reason of s 368(5) of the Legal Profession Act . 47 The Application to have the Bankruptcy Notice as served on 11 February 2008 set aside should thus be allowed. 48 The orders of the Court are: 1. The Application be allowed. 2. The Bankruptcy Notice No NN 0290 of 2008 be set aside. 3. The Respondent is to pay the costs of the Applicant.

Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

Albeit addressing the provisions in the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW), Dunford J there observed: [56] Having regard to the status and powers of Costs Assessors and the ordinary meaning of the word ""assessor"", I am satisfied that the powers of Costs Assessors are limited to determining the value of the work done or services rendered in circumstances where there is no dispute that costs are payable and the only issue is as to the amount. It is no part of their function to determine whether or when such costs are payable. The matters set out in s 208A which they must, and in s 208B which they may, take into account are all matters relevant to putting a value on the work done or services rendered and the fairness or justice of the amount claimed; but are not matters which relate to the terms of a costs agreement (particularly if oral) and whether any conditions precedent to payment have been fulfilled. The determination of such questions requires the reception of sworn evidence, which can be tested by cross-examination, and an assessment of such evidence. Costs Assessors do not have the power to deal with such matters. [57] For similar reasons it has been held that a Costs Assessor has no power to hear a cross-claim by a client against a solicitor based on negligence, nor to award damages: Ryan v Hansen, supra per Kirby J; or to make an assessment when no costs are presently due and payable: Lace v Younan [1999] NSWSC 1072 per Master Harrison (no bill of costs rendered); Baker v Kearney [2002] NSWSC 746 per Master Malpass (judgment in District Court that applicant for assessment not entitled to costs). I am therefore satisfied that on being notified of the dispute as to the plaintiff's liability to pay the costs, the Costs Assessor should have declined to make a determination or issued a certificate unless and until such issue was resolved. Nothing said by the Court of Appeal in Wentworth v Rogers [2006] NSWCA 145 , 66 NSWLR 474 detracts from this particular conclusion of Dunford J.

Case515,Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393,"Some decisions involving the application of s 40(1)(g) have involved circumstances in which a costs order has been made in an interlocutory application and the question as to whether the "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" sought to be relied upon could have been raised in that interlocutory application. Notwithstanding the interlocutory nature of a proceeding, reliance in such cases is placed upon s 40(3) of the 1966 Act which relevantly provides as follows: For the purposes of paragraph (1)(g): ... (b) a judgment or order that is enforceable as, or in the same manner as, a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which, or in consequence of which, the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained; ... One such decision is Re Gould; Ex parte Skinner (1983) 72 FLR 393. An application had there been made for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the sale of property. That application failed because there was a failure to establish that an undertaking as to damages would have had any substance. The cross-claim or set off was there said to be a claim for damages for breach of an obligation as encumbrancee to exercise reasonable care with respect to the sale of the property. That cross-claim or set-off, Fitzgerald J held, could not have been set up in the action seeking the interlocutory injunction. His Honour concluded (at 407 8): It was not in dispute before me that the order for costs upon the dismissal of the application for an interlocutory injunction in Queensland Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982 is one which is enforceable as or in the same manner as a final judgment obtained in an action in that Court. The order for costs is therefore deemed by s 40(3)(b) of the Act to be a ""final judgment so obtained"", that is, a ""final judgment"" obtained in an ""action"". However, s 40(3)(b) of the Act does not stop there; the ""action"" is identified. For the purposes of s 40(1)(g), the statutory fiction effected by the deeming is extended to convert the ""proceedings"" in which the order was in fact obtained into the ""action"" in which the notional ""final judgment"" was obtained. In my opinion, the test in such circumstances called for by s 40(1)(g) of the Act is to ascertain not whether the cross demand could have been set up in the Supreme Court action No 1473 of 1982, but whether it could have been set up in the deemed action, the proceeding in which the order for costs was made, that is, the application for an interlocutory injunction in that action. The answer is clearly negative. ... Another comparable decision is Chesson v Smith (1992) 35 FCR 594. An application had there been filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to commence proceedings under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984 (NSW) out of time. The application was dismissed with costs. A certificate of taxation issued and, subsequently, a bankruptcy notice. It was accepted that there was a cross demand which exceeded the debt. But it was not a cross demand which could have been set up in the "" proceeding "", that "" proceeding "" either being the application for the interlocutory order for leave or the application for the costs order in that interlocutory application. 34 In the present Application there was a lack of precision in the identification by the Applicant of the "" action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained "". At the outset of oral submissions it was contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was to be found in the Supreme Court proceedings and was either: (i) the claim for declaratory relief, together with costs; or, more narrowly (ii) the claim for the costs order. An analogy was sought to be drawn between the interlocutory nature of the "" proceeding "" before Hall J in the Supreme Court and the decisions in Re Gould and Chesson v Smith . The narrower the identification of the "" proceeding "", the easier the Applicant contended it was to conclude that the claim in respect of losses could not have been set up as an answer. A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that "" where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings, that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained (see s40(3)(b)) "". By the end of oral submissions, however, the Applicant contended that the "" action or proceeding "" was: (iii) the "" proceeding "" in the District Court whereby judgment was entered for the sum of money assessed in the Certificate of Determination of Costs .",Criminal Case,Rape,0.061,0.038,0.901,0.9764,6.394400000000001

Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor.

O'Loughlin J there observed (at 212): The reference in s 40(1)(g) of the Act to a counterclaim that could not have been set up in the proceedings exists for the protection of the debtor. Notwithstanding that his creditor may have obtained a judgment against him, that judgment cannot be used to found a bankruptcy notice if there is -- outside the spectrum of those legal proceedings -- a counterclaim of equal or greater size. But the Act intends a debtor, at the earliest opportunity, to raise against his creditor such counterclaim, if any, as he may have and which can be properly raised in the creditor's proceedings; if he does not he cannot complain (by way of raising that counter-claim) when the creditor applies to this court to issue a bankruptcy notice.

These comments have since been approved by the Full Court: Smart v Esanda Finance Corp Ltd [2000] FCA 235 at [17] per Lee, Goldberg and Kenny JJ. See also: Tzovaras v Nufeno Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1152 at [34] [35] per Jacobson J. In Re Ling , Hill J concluded that a claim could be set up in the Federal Court as against the Commonwealth even though to do so the judgment debtor would have had to have commenced proceedings in the High Court of Australia and to have had those proceedings remitted to the Federal Court. The fact that such a "" tortuous route "" had to be followed did not mean that the proceeding could not have been set up in the Federal Court. His Honour reviewed some of the authorities and concluded (at 137): These cases, it seems to me, establish that a cross-claim will be one which could be set up in the action, notwithstanding that to do so the debtor may need to transfer the proceedings first to another court, or may need to obtain in his or her favour the exercise of a discretion before doing so. The onus of showing that the claim is not one that could have been set up in the creditor's proceedings lies upon the debtor. That onus will not be satisfied merely by showing that some indirect course may need be followed (that course being in the discretion of the debtor) nor by showing that there existed a discretion which could have been exercised against the setting up of the claim as a cross-claim. To satisfy that onus the debtor must show that, as a matter of law and in the circumstances prevailing, he or she could not have set up the cross-claim. That the debtor has not done in the present case. In Nath v Clipway Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 625 at [4] Spender J agreed with these observations of Hill J. Kiefel and Hely JJ agreed with Spender J.

Case519,Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184,"It is not considered that the "" final judgment or final order "" could be constituted by the order for costs made by the Supreme Court, either on its own or together with the Certificate of Determination of Costs : Franks v Warringah Council [2003] FCA 1047 , 131 FCR 287. A certificate that sets out the determination of the costs assessor, without being filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, is not sufficient to found a bankruptcy notice: Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122 at [53] , 157 FCR 313 at 319 per Jacobson J. In Franks , the Land and Environment Court had there ordered that the Council's costs be agreed or assessed under the then Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW). A bankruptcy notice was served, the schedule to which stated that costs had been so assessed and annexed a certificate. Branson J summarised the submissions there being advanced as follows: [16] It was submitted by the Council that the argument that it could only recover its costs by filing in a court of competent jurisdiction a certificate issued pursuant to s 208J of the Legal Profession Act was contrary to established authority and the proper construction of the relevant legislation. The Council submitted that in respect of each order of the Land and Environment Court, having received the determination of the costs assessor, it had two options open to it for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . The first option, it argued, was the option of filing the certificate issued under s 208J of the Legal Profession Act in a court of competent jurisdiction and issuing a bankruptcy notice on the judgment thereby deemed to have been obtained. The second option, it argued, was the option which it in fact adopted; that is, the option of issuing a bankruptcy notice founded on the order of the Land and Environment Court supported by the certificate issued under s 208J. The Council contended that the second of these options remained open to it even after it had filed in a court of competent jurisdiction the certificate issued by the costs assessor. Her Honour reviewed the authorities and then concluded: [30] The submissions of the Council identified in [16] are, in my view, unsustainable. Section 40(1)(g) does not, as it seems to me, admit of the possibility that a creditor may have obtained against a debtor more than one final judgment or final order in respect of the one debt, or perhaps more accurately, sourced from the same obligation. Further, s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act refers only to final judgments and final orders that can be enforced by a writ of execution (Re Pannowitz; Ex parte Wilson (1975) 38 FLR 184 at 198 per Riley J). I incline to the view that Pt 44 r 7 of the Supreme Court Rules (NSW), as presently worded, does not allow a writ of execution to issue in respect of the orders of the Land and Environment Court on which reliance is here placed. It seems to me to be implicit in Pt 44, r 7, as presently worded, that a writ of execution may only issue in respect of costs determined under the Legal Profession Act to enforce a judgment entered as a result of the filing of a certificate under the Legal Profession Act . ... [32] I conclude that each of the bankruptcy notices should be set aside on the basis that it is fatally flawed because the judgment or order upon which it is founded, and which is attached to it as required by Form 1, is not ""a final judgment or final order, being a judgment or order the execution of which has not been stayed"" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act . 36 The "" final judgment or final order "" in the present proceeding, it was ultimately submitted by the Applicant, was the judgment of the District Court. The form of a bankruptcy notice is that prescribed by reg 4.02 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) and clause 2 to that form provides as follows: The creditor claims that the debt is due and payable by you. A copy of the judgments or orders relied upon by the creditor is attached. At the time of applying for this Notice, execution of the judgments or orders had not been stayed.

(1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action.

Notwithstanding that his creditor may have obtained a judgment against him, that judgment cannot be used to found a bankruptcy notice if there is -- outside the spectrum of those legal proceedings -- a counterclaim of equal or greater size. But the Act intends a debtor, at the earliest opportunity, to raise against his creditor such counterclaim, if any, as he may have and which can be properly raised in the creditor's proceedings; if he does not he cannot complain (by way of raising that counter-claim) when the creditor applies to this court to issue a bankruptcy notice.

In determining whether representations have been conveyed to the public (such as by a mass media or internet publication) the Court usually must identify the effect of the publication, including what representations it made, on ordinary or reasonable members of the public: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85-86 [101] - [103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

Ms Ra asserted that the length of the trial would increase from one to two weeks to four to five weeks if there were a jury. I reject that submission. In my opinion it is unlikely that the length of the trial will be any greater with a jury. Essentially, the issues for trial will revolve around the oral evidence of witnesses concerning what did or did not happen in Ms Ra's business so far as that relates to the issues in the matters complained of. Ms Ra also relied on a suggestion that the police or prosecution brief, for the purposes of the criminal proceedings, consisted of about 40 lever arch folders of documents. There was no evidence before me that any substantial amount of this material is likely to be adduced in evidence. The allegations that Ms Ra mistreated young women in her employ and exploited them by imposing significant debts on them which were not otherwise merited are the issues at the heart of this matter. It is unlikely that young women providing sexual services in a brothel would be engaged in keeping significant books of account, involving the necessity for prolonged examination of those documents. Nor would Ms Ra's records of their wages or debts be likely to be complex. Such documents as may be relevant to those issues are highly likely to be understood by a jury. If those documents were kept in a foreign language the jury would be likely to be concerned only with their translation.

That occurred more than a year before he became Prime Minister in Hawke v Tamworth Newspaper Co Ltd [1983] 1 NSWLR 699 at 706E-707B. Where a person is a contentious figure or one with a prominent public role, his or her position as a party to an action tried before a jury may cause concern about its potential effect on a jury of 4 persons. He or she is more likely to be given a dispassionate and fair trial by a jury of 12. This is because a larger jury is more likely to dilute the influence of any single juror whose passions or antipathies are aroused for or against one of the parties. Balanced against that concern, must be the Court's recognition that jurors obey the directions of trial judges to put aside their own personal prejudices and feelings. And members of a jury panel ordinarily can be expected to accept the invitation before being called to the box, to indicate whether they feel they could not bring an impartial and dispassionate mind to the resolution of the issues for trial or by reason of the matters disclosed to them as to what the proceedings are about and who the parties are; see s 38(8) of the Jury Act which provides: ""(8) Before the selection of the jury at a civil trial, the judge must, subject to the regulations: (a) direct the parties to the proceedings to inform the jurors on the panel of the nature of the action and the identity of the parties and of the principal witnesses to be called by the parties, and (b) call on the jurors on the panel to apply to be excused if they consider that they are not able to give impartial consideration to the case."" Here the publications are in a daily newspaper with a large circulation in Sydney, and contemporaneous internet publications of the same or similar material. They allege criminal and other serious wrongdoing by Ms Ra. And she has the highly contentious occupation of running a brothel. I am comfortably satisfied that the nature of the publications complained of here and the fact that, on this application at least, no challenge has been made to their capacity to convey the imputations alleged raise matters which could well excite prejudice in some members of the community, particularly those with strong moral views against Ms Ra. Such moral views might be held by a member of the jury. I am of opinion that an expanded jury of 12 is more likely to reflect and balance the range of community values, morality and thought so as to ensure a fair trial. Accordingly, I will grant Ms Ra's application that the jury be a jury of 12.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.112,0.04,0.848,0.9874,6.383900000000001

Case542,R v Shipley ( The Dean of St Asaph's Case ) (1784) 4 Doug 73,"Suk Ra is a brothel owner. She commenced these proceedings against the publisher of The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Nationwide News Pty Limited and its associated company, News Digital Media Pty Limited. News Digital publishes material on the internet including extracts from the Daily Telegraph . On 3 December 2008, The Daily Telegraph also published an editorial headed ""Sydney's Own Horror House"". The text of the editorial appears to have been republished on the internet by News Digital on either 3 or 4 December. On the same day the Daily Telegraph published an article under the headline ""Sex Slave Trade Revealed"". The article had a subheading, ""Brothel Madam Walks Scott Free"". On 4 December 2008, News Digital published an internet article headed ""No Way Out for Women in Debt and Total Despair"". A web blog or section on the News Digital website allowed readers to post comments on this article. On and after 4 December 2008 a number of comments were posted on this part of the website. Ms Ra claimed that each of these publications contravened s 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). She alleged that one or other of the publishers had engaged in conduct that was liable to mislead persons seeking such employment as to the nature, terms or conditions of that employment by making a variety of misleading representations in each of the five publications in relation to employment that was or may be offered by her. In times less free than those in which we now live, the charge of criminal libel was often employed as a means of censoring freedom of expression and opinion. Until the passage of Fox's Libel Act in 1792 (32 Geo 3 c 60), the judges of England had asserted that it was their province to determine whether or not a matter was defamatory: R v Shipley ( The Dean of St Asaph's Case ) (1784) 4 Doug 73 at 164-165 per Lord Mansfield CJ, as explained by Lord Blackburn in The Capital and Counties Bank v Henty (1882) 7 App Cas 741 at 772-776. But juries constantly defied them by refusing to convict on a direction by a judge that the matter complained of was libellous. Fox's Libel Act squarely placed the decision of whether or not the matter complained of was a libel in the hands of the jury, and there it has remained in England to the present time, as it has until recent times in many of the Australian States. Lord Denning graphically explained, in his inimitable style, some of the history that informed the passage of Fox's Libel Act in Landmarks in The Law (1984) at 284-294.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.03,0.048,0.922,-0.7433,0.4164500000000002
Case543,Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606,"concept of ""reputation"" in the law of defamation comprehends all aspects of a person's standing in the community: Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606 at 616 [36] per French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ. The importance of the law of defamation in balancing the right of an individual to the protection of his or her reputation and the right commonly described as freedom of speech plays a crucial role in our democratic system of government. That balance is affected at common law by the operation of the defence of qualified privilege as elaborated in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 , see at 565-576 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The test does not imply that the hypothetical referees will exercise a moral judgment about the plaintiff or applicant because of what is said about him or her. Rather, the test identifies the attributes of persons who share the standards of the general community and will apply them: Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38]. And, the moral or ethical standards held by the general community may be relevant to imputations which reflect upon a person's business or professional reputation: Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]. The standard to be applied must be one common to society rather than one which reflects an attitude of a section of it: Chesterton 254 ALR at 619 [48]. French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ continued ( Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]: ""In such cases the ordinary reasonable person may be expected to draw upon such community standards as may be relevant, in order to answer the question whether there has been injury to that reputation."" I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ends of justice render it expedient to direct a trial by jury of all issues in the proceedings, other than damages and any other issue which, pursuant to the Defamation Act would not be left to the jury. Thus, the question of the capacity of the matters complained of to convey any of the defamatory meanings alleged (as opposed to whether they in fact were conveyed) would remain a question of law to be decided by a judge. The part of this controversy that arises under s 53B of the Trade Practices Act should also be decided by a jury. This is because it is inextricably related to the meanings conveyed to ordinary reasonable readers by the matters complained of and whether Ms Ra has been injured in her reputation as an employer for the purposes of s 53B. However, if the jury returned a verdict in her favour on the issues of liability, the amount of compensation to be awarded pursuant to s 82 of that Act should be assessed by a judge.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.089,0.041,0.87,0.9764,6.369400000000001
Case544,Reader's Digest Services Pty Limited v Lamb [1982] HCA 4 ; (1982) 150 CLR 500,"of the great virtues of having a jury try the substantial factual issues in a defamation action is that they represent the very audience to which the defamatory publication was addressed. In assessing whether or not a publication, first, is defamatory in the sense complained of and, secondly, has been defended under defences such as truth, honest opinion or fair report, a jury of ordinary reasonable people is able to evaluate the competing factual issues bringing to bear the moral and social standards that they share with the community at large. And, they are better placed than judicial officers to assess how ordinary reasonable people understand mass media publications. In Reader's Digest Services Pty Limited v Lamb [1982] HCA 4 ; (1982) 150 CLR 500 at 505-506 Brennan J, with whom Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Murphy and Wilson JJ agreed said: ""Where no true innuendo is pleaded and the published words clearly related to the plaintiff, the issue of libel or no libel can be determined by asking whether hypothetical referees -- Lord Selborne's reasonable men ( Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty (1882) LR 7 App Cas 741 , at p 745) or Lord Atkin's right-thinking members of society generally ( Sim v. Stretch (1936) 52 TLR 669 , at p 671) or Lord Reid's ordinary men not avid for scandal ( Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. [1964] AC, at p 260)) -- would understand the published words in a defamatory sense. That simple question embraces two elements of the cause of action: the meaning of the words used (the imputation) and the defamatory character of the imputation. Whether the alleged libel is established depends upon the understanding of the hypothetical referees who are taken to have a uniform view of the meaning of the language used, and upon the standards, moral or social, by which they evaluate the imputation they understand to have been made. They are taken to share a moral or social standard by which to judge the defamatory character of that imputation ( Byrne v. Deane [1937] 1 KB 818 , at p. 833, being a standard common to society generally ( Miller v. David (1874) LR 9 CP 118 ; Myroft v. Sleight (1921) 90 LJKB 883 ; Tolley v. J.S. Fry &amp; Sons Ltd. [1930] 1 KB 467, at p. 479)."" (emphasis added) Brennan J went on to say ( Lamb 150 CLR at 506): ""But the moral or social standard by which the defamatory character of an imputation is determined is not amenable to evidentiary proof; it is pre-eminently a matter for the jury to give effect to a standard which they consider to accord with the attitude of society generally ."" (emphasis added) This matter raises issues that very much involve giving effect to moral and social values of the community. I am satisfied that a trial by a jury would be a better mode of trial than by judge alone to assess the various claims and defences in these defamation proceedings. The jury will be better able to make such an assessment than a judge and to do so in a way likely to arrive at a reflection of the attitude of society generally: Lamb 150 CLR at 506. I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506.

Case552,Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213,"The respondents' construction of s 824(1) was founded upon Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (WA) v Woolworths Ltd (2006) 149 IR 213 (' Woolworths' ). The case concerned the costs of a directions hearing at which the applicant advised the Court that it no longer wished to pursue its claim for interim relief to restrain the certification of an agreement under the WRA. The claim was not pursued because the agreement had in fact been certified after the institution of the proceedings but prior to the directions date, without the knowledge of the applicant. The respondent sought costs on the basis that the applicant had not mounted its interim application urgently and in accordance with the rules concerning the filing of affidavit evidence. 14 In the present case, the respondents relied on Nicholson J's statement at 214-215 [8] that the proviso to s 347(1) afforded no ground for making a costs order in respect of a step in the proceeding, as distinguished from the institution of the proceeding. However, it is not clear that the reference by Nicholson J to a 'step in the proceeding' was directed to the application for interim relief, rather than to particular procedural 'steps' in relation to that application. On my reading, Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding, as he went on to say at 214-215 [8] that: 'the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and [was] one which remained, in the applicant's mind, reasonable throughout, until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement.' This simply amounts to a finding that, on the facts, costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s 347(1) because the interlocutory application was not instituted 'vexatiously or without reasonable cause'. In my opinion, Woolworths does not support the respondents' contention that costs cannot be awarded under 824(1) in respect of an interlocutory notice of motion.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.038,0.884,0.9451,6.26985

Case568,Bissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 365,"Section 84(5) of the Native Title Act provides that the Federal Court may join any person as a party to proceedings under the Act if it is satisfied that 'the person's interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings'. NTS is no stranger to applications made under this section. In Bissett v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 365 , Tamberlin J considered an application for the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council to withdraw as a party from a native title proceeding and for NTS to be joined as a party. In December 2001 the status of the Land Council as a Native Title Representative Body was withdrawn at its own request. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission decided to grant funds to NTS to assist in certain activities including carrying out the functions of a representative body as set out in s 203B of the Native Title Act .",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.126,0.021,0.853,0.9485,6.21475
Case569,Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1,"In deciding whether NTS had the requisite interest under s 84(5) , Tamberlin J applied the principles identified by the Full Court in Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1. His Honour agreed with the views of Katz J in Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of NSW [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527 that despite amendments to the Native Title Act the reasoning in Byron was applicable to the case before him. His Honour summarised the Full Court's views as follows, at [13]: 'In Byron Environment Centre , the Full Court held that although the relevant ""interests"" are not confined to interest in land or water, they do not extend to mere emotional associations, ideological or bare intellectual interests in the subject matter of the application. The ""interests"" must not be indirect, remote or lacking in substance and must be capable of clear definition such that they may be affected in a discernible way in relation to the application: at 7-10 per Black CJ.' 7 Tamberlin J considered the functions of a representative body and considered that they would be facilitated if NTS were a party to the proceeding. His Honour also observed that the expression, 'a determination in the proceedings' should not be equated with a final determination of native title rights. In considering the nature of the 'interests' referred to in the section, his Honour said at [24]: 'In relation to the asserted appropriateness of a narrow construction of the expression ""interests"" because of a power to veto an otherwise agreed settlement, the provisions of s 84(8) should be borne in mind. The provision empowers the Court at any time to order a party other than an applicant to cease to be a party to the proceedings. This power could be invoked by the Court if a representative body is a party to the proceedings and adopts a grossly unreasonable approach in relation to a proposed consensual determination of the proceedings. In addition, it should be kept in mind that the Court must always be satisfied that the person or body has the requisite interest in any particular circumstances and this provides a safeguard on the extent to which other persons or bodies can be joined.' 8 Tamberlin J held that NTS had a sufficient interest to meet the requirement of s 84(5) and that the application for joinder should be allowed. For the same reasons I am satisfied that NTS has sufficient interest in the compensation application and the order for joinder in this proceeding should be made. 9 NTS has brought the present application to dismiss the proceedings under O 35A r3(1) of the Federal Court Rules because of a failure to progress the compensation claim. The following history of the matter, which I accept as correct, is taken from the affidavit of Mr Savidis. 10 The compensation application covers an area ""identical to the external boundaries of the Barkandji Traditional Owner's Application (NSD 6084 of 1998)"" in which NTS is a party and the legal representative of the applicant. This application, known as the Barkandji #8 application, was first lodged with the Tribunal on 8 October 1997.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.154,0.018,0.828,0.997,6.3535

Sackville J expressed those reasons as follows (at [789]): &#8226; 'First, the applicants have not shown, on the evidence, that the indigenous witnesses, or members of the compensation claim group, acknowledged and observed at the relevant times the laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc as pleaded in the Points of Claim . &#8226; Secondly, I am not satisfied that any laws and customs relating to rights and interests in land that may have been acknowledged and observed by the Aboriginal witnesses are the traditional laws and customs of the Western Desert bloc, within the meaning of s 223(1) of the NTA.' 21 Given the lack of progress with the present application, there is no reasonable prospect of such evidence ever being produced. Under the circumstances, I accept that NTS has done everything possible to ensure that those who might have an interest in the claim have been consulted about the present application. They have obtained full support from all persons they have been able to contact except Dorothy and Phillip Lawson.

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law.

Case578,Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1621,"The applicant made a number of claims against the respondents. Those claims are outlined in my liability reasons: Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1621. The applicant was unsuccessful as to the majority of its claims. It was unsuccessful as to what it presented as the main claim, namely, that there was an implied term in a contract between it and Graphix Labels Pty Ltd which prevented Graphix Labels from manufacturing and selling skins. The applicant submitted that one order as to costs should be made and it should be an order in its favour. The problem for the applicant is that if it is appropriate to make only one order as to costs, and that order should be in favour of the successful party, or the party who has been largely successful, then neither party has been wholly successful, and it is the respondents who have been largely successful. The respondents have been largely successful in that they have resisted the majority of the applicant's claims including what was the main claim advanced by the applicant. The applicant's counsel attempted to argue that in terms of witnesses and their evidence, the case and the costs associated with it would have been the same, or more or less the same, even if it had not pursued the claims upon which it was unsuccessful. He also submitted that the applicant had been successful as to some claims and unsuccessful as to others. The applicant's attempts to characterise the proceedings in that way must fail because the fact is that the applicant failed on its main claim and the bulk of its other claims. My reasons for reaching that conclusion are apparent from my liability reasons and require no further elaboration. 7 For their part, the respondents submitted that the success or benefit ultimately achieved by the applicant in pursuing the proceedings, as reflected in my orders, was slight, whereas the costs were substantial. The success or benefit was submitted to be so slight that when regard is had to the undertakings as to the artworks offered by the respondent at the outset, the success or benefit achieved by the applicant should be ignored. As I understood the submission, it was that in practical terms the respondents have been successful. It follows, so it was submitted, that an order for costs should be made in their favour albeit the costs should be assessed on different bases for different periods. 8 In my opinion, the respondents' submission should be rejected for two reasons. First, the applicant has succeeded in its claim for infringement of copyright in relation to the artworks and for breach of an implied term in relation to samples containing the artworks. In relation to the first-mentioned claim, the applicant has received an award of damages including additional damages which, although modest, were based partly on a finding that the infringement was flagrant. Secondly, the undertakings proffered by the respondents to the applicant not to use the artworks were made with a denial of liability and did not include any indication that the respondents would pay damages or consent to an order for the assessment of damages. The applicant pointed out to the respondents in correspondence that they had not explained the basis upon which they denied liability for infringement of copyright. The denial of liability was maintained in the defence and indeed it was maintained until the fifth day of trial. I was told that the reason for the denial was that the respondents were not satisfied that the artworks were original works, but even if the reason for the denial is relevant, the particular reason was not conveyed to the applicant in their correspondence or in the defence in a way that may have reduced costs. It may be that the important fact is not that the respondents did not offer to pay damages or consent to an assessment of damages but, rather, the fact that ultimately the applicant received an award of damages.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.089,0.083,0.827,0.5645,4.966749999999999

Case583,Australian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd (1997) 49 ALD 411,"Kennedy complained that the Panel erred by failing to identify the evidence, if any, it relied on to arrive at the finding that the period of Mr Kennedy's serious misfortune was limited to the periods between February to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000. It was submitted that, had it done so, it may have been possible to discern why it considered that Mr Kennedy had not established his claim for the longer period during which he said he had suffered such misfortune: see Australian Trade Commission v Underwood Exports Pty Ltd (1997) 49 ALD 411 at 422. In this Court he tacitly accepted the Panel's finding that the relevant period concluded in May 2000 and confined himself to arguing that the Panel should have found that he was incapacitated continuously from February 1998 to May 2000. To establish an error of law, Mr Kennedy must show that there was no evidence that was accepted by the Panel which supported its finding that the period of serious misfortune suffered by him was limited to February 1998 to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000. The Panel dealt with the period of Mr Kennedy's serious misfortune in paragraphs 62 and 81-3 of its reasons: see at [21] above. In paragraph 83, the Panel found that ""on the whole of the evidence"" Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune for these two periods. Implicitly, it did not accept that Mr Kennedy suffered serious misfortune from December 1998 to June 1999 or from May 2000 to May 2001. In the course of its reasons the Panel referred to various parts of the evidence, including:",Criminal Case,Murder,0.022,0.14,0.839,-0.9828,-0.3188
Case584,Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321,"complains that question (a) lacks precision because it does not specify for what period a permit must be ""active"". AFMA submits there are four potential periods: active over the whole five year qualifying period (1997 to 2001 inclusive), active over the best two years, active over one year or active over the period of serious misfortune. As a result, an answer to that question could not assist Mr Kennedy. Further, AFMA submits that the resolution of the question in 2(aa) would give Mr Kennedy no entitlement to relief nor would it identify an error of law: see Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 326-327. In any event, AFMA submits that the Panel did not make a finding upon which question 2(aa) is based. AFMA also complains that questions 2(d) and 2(e) do not raise pure questions of law. Section 161 of the Act, like s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (""the AAT Act""), allows an appeal to this Court only on a question of law. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal under s 44, but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself: see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J.

It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal"" (emphasis added). In other cases in which the Court has been confronted with this problem and in which it has determined that it might be possible to frame an appropriate question of law, it has done so itself: see, for example, Birdseye . Under the cover of its objections to the competency of the appeal, AFMA conceded that questions of law could possibly be framed and argued on the substantive issues raised by Mr Kennedy. In the event, AFMA will suffer no prejudice if I attempt to frame questions of law. In my view, it is possible to identify three questions of law: Whether, on the proper construction of s 27 of the Management Plan, AFMA and the Panel are bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person's serious misfortune when determining ""the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be)"" under s 27(1)(c)? Whether on the proper construction of s 27 of the Management Plan, AFMA and the Panel were bound to take into account all permits extant during the period of an eligible person's serious misfortune when determining ""the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits"" under s 27(1)(d)? Whether there was any evidence before the Panel upon which it was open to it to find that the period of serious misfortune suffered by Mr Kennedy was limited to the periods from February 1998 to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000? Section 27 is an ameliorative provision which operates to the benefit of an eligible person who has suffered serious misfortune. When a person has suffered serious misfortune, AFMA may calculate: the best two years' catches of a species of fish under the sequence of permits by using, for the period of serious misfortune, the average catch of the species in the fishery under all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be) during that period (s 27(1)(c)); and the best two years' sets for the relevant sequence of permits for step 1 of the definition of set history in s 26(3), by using, for the period of the serious misfortune, the average number of times a longline was set in the fishery under all sequences of old longline permits during that period: s 27(1)(d) (set history was not incorporated in the formula for calculating quota SFRs for people who held old minor line permits). Mr Kennedy held an old longline permit. The relevant sequences of permits are therefore sequences of old longline permits. The Panel determined that Mr Kennedy had suffered serious misfortune within the meaning of s 27. In those circumstances, section 27(1) provides that ""AFMA may"" perform the calculations in s 26 by using the average catch of the relevant species under all sequences of longline permits (s 27(1)(c)) and the average number of times a longline was set under all sequences of longline permits (s 27(1)(d)) in calculating the number of SFRs to be granted to Mr Kennedy under s 26. Finally, it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy, in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision, is an order in the nature of mandamus: at 224. That remedy can, and should, be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s 161 of the Act. The right of appeal, given by s 161, is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel. The question must, therefore, be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure, on the part of the Panel, to satisfy its statutory obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. Such a failure, in my view, does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself. Question of law 2(c) asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. A negative answer to that question would not, however, have revealed any error affecting the Panel's decision: cf Birdseye at 326 (per Branson and Stone JJ). It could not, therefore, have assisted Mr Kennedy.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.055,0.875,0.9643,6.360050000000001

His Honour suggested two additional considerations which supported Finkelstein J's reasons for doubting the correctness of the decision in Dornan . These additional considerations were: ""First, the reasons which attend an administrative decision are conceptually distinct from that decision and it is the decision, and not the reasons which accompany it, which is the subject of judicial review or, as here, appeal under s 44. The reasons have no legal consequences in themselves. Rather, they provide material from which arguments about the correctness of the decision may be crafted. Their legal relevance is, therefore, derivative from the decision to which they are appurtenant. ... ... Second, once the derivative nature is understood it must follow that the legal requirements attending the production of reasons need have no necessary connexion with the legal requirements attending the decision. A decision accompanied by perfectly adequate reasons may be riddled with legal errors just as a decision which is accompanied by inadequate reasons may be legal impeccable. The fallacy in the view that the provision of inadequate reasons is an error of law in the decision springs from the conflation of rules concerned with the making of the decision itself with rules concerned with the provision of reasons, a conflation which is, in my opinion, wholly without warrant. This is not to say that questions of law do not arise from the operation of rules about the provision of reasons. It is only to say that such questions arise dehors the decision and cannot be errors in the decision itself"": at 337-8. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.078,0.083,0.839,-0.672,0.6529999999999996
Case586,Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137,"already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137. These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision. In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied. In Dornan , the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law. In Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137 , the Full Court was concerned with an appeal, under s 44 of the AAT Act, from a decision of the Tribunal to set aside a decision of the Authority to cancel a certificate of approval. Both parties to the appeal accepted that the Tribunal had failed to satisfy the obligation, imposed on it, by s 43(2) of the AAT Act, to provide adequate reasons for its decision. It was common ground that such a failure constituted a ""question of law"" for the purposes of s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The Full Court said (at [42] - [43]) that: ""In circumstances such as the present, where it is common ground that there is a statutory entitlement to reasons and where such reasons have not been provided and cannot now be provided by the Tribunal member who made the decision, it is inevitable that the decision itself must be set aside. The primary judge correctly concluded that there had been non-compliance with s 43(2) and ordered that reasons now be provided by the original decision-maker. Compliance with that order is no longer possible. Because of the accepted failure to comply with s 43(2), the Tribunal decision must be set aside and the matter remitted for a new hearing in the Tribunal"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.088,0.055,0.857,0.7783,5.691050000000001

Case588,Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647,"approach did not enjoy universal acceptance. In Comcare v Lees (1997) 151 ALR 647 at 656-9, Finkelstein J reviewed the authorities which commenced with Dornan and concluded that, were he not bound by these decisions, he would not follow them. He drew attention to conflicting decisions, including that of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-6 and the English Divisional Court in Mountview Court Properties Ltd v Devlin (1970) 21 P &amp; CR 689. He considered it to be inappropriate to draw on cases in which appellate courts found reasons to be inadequate because, in such cases, no remedies such as a statutory order in the nature of mandamus were available to require the relevant trial judges to rectify the deficiencies in their reasons. His Honour also noted that, in the appellate context, the appellable error was founded on common law doctrine rather than on the construction of a statutory obligation to provide reasons. One might add that there is no compelling reason for treating a decision as errant solely because no reasons or no adequate reasons have been advanced to support it, unless one was attracted to Lord Denning's notion that, if a decision-maker fails to give reasons for a decision, a reviewing court could infer that he did not have any good reasons: see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1 ; [1968] AC 997 at 1007.

He drew attention to conflicting decisions, including that of Brennan J in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien [1985] HCA 10 ; (1985) 155 CLR 422 at 445-6 and the English Divisional Court in Mountview Court Properties Ltd v Devlin (1970) 21 P &amp; CR 689. He considered it to be inappropriate to draw on cases in which appellate courts found reasons to be inadequate because, in such cases, no remedies such as a statutory order in the nature of mandamus were available to require the relevant trial judges to rectify the deficiencies in their reasons. His Honour also noted that, in the appellate context, the appellable error was founded on common law doctrine rather than on the construction of a statutory obligation to provide reasons. One might add that there is no compelling reason for treating a decision as errant solely because no reasons or no adequate reasons have been advanced to support it, unless one was attracted to Lord Denning's notion that, if a decision-maker fails to give reasons for a decision, a reviewing court could infer that he did not have any good reasons: see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1 ; [1968] AC 997 at 1007. In Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 337 Perram J, without expressing a concluded view, said that there was ""much to be said"" for the views of Finkelstein J in Lees . His Honour suggested two additional considerations which supported Finkelstein J's reasons for doubting the correctness of the decision in Dornan . These additional considerations were: ""First, the reasons which attend an administrative decision are conceptually distinct from that decision and it is the decision, and not the reasons which accompany it, which is the subject of judicial review or, as here, appeal under s 44. The reasons have no legal consequences in themselves. Rather, they provide material from which arguments about the correctness of the decision may be crafted. Their legal relevance is, therefore, derivative from the decision to which they are appurtenant. ... ... Second, once the derivative nature is understood it must follow that the legal requirements attending the production of reasons need have no necessary connexion with the legal requirements attending the decision. A decision accompanied by perfectly adequate reasons may be riddled with legal errors just as a decision which is accompanied by inadequate reasons may be legal impeccable. The fallacy in the view that the provision of inadequate reasons is an error of law in the decision springs from the conflation of rules concerned with the making of the decision itself with rules concerned with the provision of reasons, a conflation which is, in my opinion, wholly without warrant. This is not to say that questions of law do not arise from the operation of rules about the provision of reasons. It is only to say that such questions arise dehors the decision and cannot be errors in the decision itself"": at 337-8. The Full Court referred to Dornan and noted that, in Lees , Finkelstein J had acknowledged that he was bound to follow Dornan . It referred to Preston and Hill as authority for the proposition that a ""failure to state reasons for a decision at least in those circumstances where a statement of reasons is a requirement of the exercise of the decision-making process constitutes an error of law"": at [49].",Criminal Case,Murder,0.066,0.069,0.866,-0.8655,-0.023250000000000437

Case594,Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470,"already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137. These were cases in which the tribunal concerned had produced cryptic and uninformative reasons such that the reviewing court could not discern why it was that the tribunal had reached the impugned decision. In particular it was not possible to determine whether the correct legal principles had been applied. In Dornan , the Full Court drew on authorities such as Pettitt v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 in which appellate courts had found that trial judges erred in law if they failed to provide reasons or sufficient reasons thereby depriving the appeal court of the capacity to determine whether a verdict had been reached in accordance with law.

The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7.

Case601,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194,"Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teo (1995) 57 FCR 194 a Full Court was called on to construe various provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the Migration Regulations 1989 (Cth). It said (at 206): "" The construction of the regulations is to be approached by looking first to the statutory power in exercise of which they were made . As we have indicated, that is found in s 33 of the Act. This provides that the regulations may make provision that a person is entitled to be granted an entry permit of a particular class if the person satisfies all the prescribed criteria in relation to that class (s 33 (2)(b)). The power is expressed as being ""subject to sections 40 and 45"". Section 40 empowers the Minister to determine that the processing of entry permit applications of a specified class which have been made by persons who have entered and remained in Australia is to stop until a day specified in the notice given by him. Section 45 provides that an entry permit shall not be granted to certain deportees where an amount is still payable by them to the Commonwealth under s 65 or s 66. Section 65 deals with the costs of deportation, and s 66 with the costs of keeping deportees in custody. Further, s 34 imposes upon the Minister an obligation, where the relevant jurisdictional pre-condition is established, either to grant or refuse an entry permit. Judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal is confined by s 138 to an ""appeal"" which is ""on a question of law"". The result, if the statute and the regulations are taken as a whole, is to disclose a compromise which represents a balance between various competing interests which are involved. The particular pattern which is set in this way is not to be distorted by treating one element in it other than in accordance with the fair meaning allowed by the language which has been used. There is no reason to give a ""broad and generous construction"" to reg 131A. To do so may detract from the force given in the balance of the legislative scheme to the other interests which are involved. These include the view taken by other branches of government and reflected in the legislative text, being the statute and the regulations, of the social and material interests of the country as a whole in relation to the entry and settlement of aliens, and of the conditions which should be attached to permission to enter and stay in Australia: Robtelmes v Brenan [1906] HCA 58 ; (1906) 4 CLR 395 at 400; Pochi v MacPhee [1982] HCA 60 ; (1982) 151 CLR 101 at 106"" (emphasis added). It may be accepted that a purpose of s 27 is to ameliorate the effect of serious misfortune on past catch and activity rates. Section 26 allows an eligible person to rely on his or her best 2 years' catches between 1997 and 2001 (inclusive). Section 27 must, therefore, seek to compensate for more than the vicissitudes of commercial fishing which are acknowledged by this part of the formula. The purpose of s 27 is not to maximise the possible benefit for an individual operator. Nor is it to put the operator in the position he or she would have been in but for the serious misfortune. That is simply not possible. The objects of ss 26 and 27 are advanced on the construction contended for by AFMA, notwithstanding that it is not the construction most advantageous to Mr Kennedy's financial interests. In my view, there is nothing in s 27 that supports Mr Kennedy's submission that the phrase ""all sequences"" in ss 27(1)(c) and (d) should be read as excluding inactive permits. It is true that s 27(1)(c) refers to ""all sequences of that kind (old longline or old minor line, as the case may be)"" which requires the person performing the calculation to limit the sequences to either old longline sequences or old minor line sequences. There is, however, nothing in s 27 which justifies further limiting ""all sequences of that kind"" to old longline sequences that were active during the period of serious misfortune. Sections 26 and 27, prescribe, with a high degree of specificity, how the grants of quota SFRs are to be calculated when a person has suffered serious misfortune. Section 27 could expressly have limited the permits that were to be included in the ""average catch"" and the ""average number of times a longline was set"" to those permits that had been used during the applicant's period of serious misfortune. It did not do so.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.067,0.026,0.907,0.9844,6.404400000000001
Case602,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"issue was considered by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323. In that case the Court dealt with a submission that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal should be set aside because the Tribunal had failed to comply with its obligations under s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to provide adequate reasons for coming to the decision. The argument was that the failure of the Tribunal to have regard to certain matters which had been pressed before it rendered its reasons inadequate with the consequence that, on this ground, its decision was a nullity. The Court rejected this argument. Gleeson CJ (at 330) was prepared to accept that, if a decision maker fails to make a finding on some question of fact in the course of giving reasons ""that will indicate that it made no finding on that matter; and that, in turn, may indicate that the Tribunal did not consider the matter to be material"". The absence of findings on a particular matter may be indicative of error but the failure to refer, in the course of giving reasons, to findings which were not made does not itself constitute reviewable error: ""It is impossible to read the expression ""the findings"" as meaning anything other than the findings which the Tribunal has made . By setting out its findings, and thereby exposing its views on materiality, the Tribunal may disclose a failure to exercise jurisdiction, or error ... or may provide some other ground for judicial review...But all the tribunal is obliged to set out is such findings as it has made ..."": at 331-2 (emphasis added). Other members of the Court made similar observations: see per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 346, 349 and 351. The issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212. In Palme the Court held that a failure to discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s 501G of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) , to give reasons for a decision to cancel a visa, did not mean that the decision could be set aside because it was tainted with jurisdictional error. Four aspects of the reasoning in Palme are of present relevance. First, it is necessary to recognise that a distinction is to be drawn between the decision and the reasons for that decision: see Palme at 225. An attack on the reasons which seeks to have the decision set aside fails to appreciate this distinction. This is a different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to, for example, a relevant consideration: cf Yusuf at 351-2. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.057,0.136,0.807,-0.9961,-0.40734999999999966
Case603,"Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme, Re [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212","issue was further considered by the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212. In Palme the Court held that a failure to discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s 501G of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) , to give reasons for a decision to cancel a visa, did not mean that the decision could be set aside because it was tainted with jurisdictional error. Four aspects of the reasoning in Palme are of present relevance. First, it is necessary to recognise that a distinction is to be drawn between the decision and the reasons for that decision: see Palme at 225. An attack on the reasons which seeks to have the decision set aside fails to appreciate this distinction. This is a different attack from one which focuses on a jurisdictional error arising from the failure of the reasons to refer to, for example, a relevant consideration: cf Yusuf at 351-2. Secondly, it is important to identify precisely what act is being impugned: Palme at 225. In Palme there was an attack by Constitutional writ on the exercise of the power to cancel a visa. In this case, there is an appeal from the Panel's decision to set aside AFMA's decision and substitute one more favourable to Mr Kennedy because it was not sufficiently favourable to his interests. The word ""decision"" in this context means the final and operative decision of the Panel as provided for in s 150(3) of the Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 47 FLR 80. Section 161 fixes on the decision as the subject matter of the appeal, not on the reasons. Thirdly, the question of whether a failure to comply with a statutory requirement to provide adequate reasons can affect the exercise of power is one of statutory construction: Palme at 225. There is nothing in the scheme of the legislation which suggests that the provision of inadequate reasons could vitiate a decision of the Panel. On the contrary, given the nature of the Panel's task, the requirement that all operators be parties to the appeal to the Panel (s 144(3) of the Act) and the fact that the allocation of SFRs cannot be implemented until after any application to the Panel is dealt with (s 23(3) of the Act), it could not readily be inferred that the Act intended that a failure to give reasons should invalidate the decision. Finally, it was held in Palme that the appropriate remedy, in the event that a tribunal fails to satisfy a statutory obligation to provide adequate reasons for a decision, is an order in the nature of mandamus: at 224. That remedy can, and should, be sought independently of any rights of appeal such as those provided for in s 161 of the Act. The right of appeal, given by s 161, is confined by the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law from the decision of the Panel. The question must, therefore, be one which arises from the decision and not from any failure, on the part of the Panel, to satisfy its statutory obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. Such a failure, in my view, does not give rise to a question of law relating to the decision itself. Question of law 2(c) asked whether the Panel had complied with the obligations imposed on it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. A negative answer to that question would not, however, have revealed any error affecting the Panel's decision: cf Birdseye at 326 (per Branson and Stone JJ). It could not, therefore, have assisted Mr Kennedy. Mr Kennedy submitted that Palme may be distinguished on the basis that there is no equivalent of s 501G(4) of the Migration Act in the Act. Where a decision has been made to refuse to grant a visa to a person or to cancel a visa, s 501G of the Migration Act requires the Minister to give the person a written notice which sets out the decision and the reasons for the decision. Section 501G(4) provides: ""A failure to comply with this section in relation to a decision does not affect the validity of the decision"". The relevant parts of the reasoning in Palme do not, however, depend on s 501G(4). As already noted, the Court emphasised the need to distinguish between a decision which is sought to be challenged and the reasons for that decision when determining whether the decision can be impeached for jurisdictional error. In their joint judgment (at 221) Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said: ""The visa cancellation decision may be reviewed in this court for jurisdictional error. Such error may be found from what is disclosed by reasons provided under s 501G(1)(e). Failure to provide reasons may also be reviewed in this Court and compliance by the Minister with the statutory duty may be ordered. The reasons then provided may furnish grounds for prohibition under s 75(v) [of the Constitution ] in respect of the visa cancellation decision. But what is not provided for is for a prosecutor, as in this case, to bypass that earlier step utilising mandamus, and to impeach the visa cancellation decision itself for want of discharge of the duty to provide reasons. There is, as was pointed out in argument, a critical distinction between failure to comply with s 501G(1)(e) and using that failure to conclude that the visa cancellation decision is flawed by jurisdictional error"". See also at 227-228 (per McHugh J). It was open to Mr Kennedy to seek an order of mandamus to compel the Panel to comply with its obligations under s 160(1) of the Act. He did not do so. Instead, he has proceeded to prosecute his appeal to this Court on the basis of the reasons which he, rightly, submits are inadequate. His failure to seek a mandatory order may have been the result of a forensic decision (cf Palme at 224) or for some other reason. Whatever the reason, the inadequacy of the Panel's reasons cannot, consistently with the decision in Palme , be relied on to impeach the Panel's decision. There is no reference, in the Full Court's reasons, to either of the High Court's decisions in Yusuf and Palme . Given that it was common ground that, in giving inadequate reasons, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error of law, I assume that the Court's attention was not drawn to these decisions although I note that, in the primary judge's reasons, His Honour observed, referring to Yusuf , that ""it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional"": see Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 49 ; (2009) 108 ALD 329 at 345. Whilst it may be accepted that the failure, on the part of a decision maker, to comply with a statutory obligation to provide reasons might constitute an error of law it does not follow that such an error is jurisdictional in nature such as to justify the setting aside of the impugned decision. That position does not change simply because the decision-maker is no longer available to provide further and better reasons. That circumstance does not, in my respectful opinion, render it inevitable that the decision under review should be set aside. In my opinion, I am bound by Palme to hold that the Panel's failure to comply with its obligations under s 160(1)(b) of the Act does not constitute a jurisdictional error which would warrant the setting aside of the Panel's decision.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.034,0.096,0.87,-0.9977,-0.4299500000000003

His Honour also noted that, in the appellate context, the appellable error was founded on common law doctrine rather than on the construction of a statutory obligation to provide reasons. One might add that there is no compelling reason for treating a decision as errant solely because no reasons or no adequate reasons have been advanced to support it, unless one was attracted to Lord Denning's notion that, if a decision-maker fails to give reasons for a decision, a reviewing court could infer that he did not have any good reasons: see Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] UKHL 1 ; [1968] AC 997 at 1007.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.049,0.098,0.853,-0.8767,-0.01945000000000041

Case610,State Electricity Commission v Commissioner for Equal Opportunity [1992] 1 VR 79,"2(c) in the notice of appeal asks whether the Panel had complied with the obligation imposed upon it by s 160(1)(b) of the Act. Section 160(1)(b) requires the Panel to prepare a written statement setting out the reasons for its decisions. Mr Kennedy complains that first, the Panel made a bald finding on his claim for serious misfortune; second that it did not provide reasons for preferring AFMA's construction of s 27 to that advanced by him; and third that the Panel did not provide reasons as to how it reached its conclusion that he suffered serious misfortune only during the February - November 1998 and July 1999 - April 2000 periods. Mr Kennedy submits that a party is entitled to know why he won or lost. A reading of the Panel's reasons would, it was submitted, leave the fair-minded reader none the wiser as to why he was only partially successful. He relied on the decision of Gobbo J in State Electricity Commission v Commissioner for Equal Opportunity [1992] 1 VR 79 in which his Honour held (at 88) that reasons for decision which fail to disclose the process of reasoning of the decision maker are ""defective and show error of law on the face of the record"". There can, in my view, be no doubt that the Panel has failed to comply with the requirements of s 160(1)(b) that it ""prepare a written statement ... setting out the reasons for [its] decision"". Were it not for another statutory provision, to which I will shortly refer, it might readily be argued that the Panel has complied with this obligation. It has produced a document of some 20 pages which contains 86 paragraphs which it has published as its reasons for its decision on Mr Kennedy's appeal. The question remains, however, whether the published reasons are sufficiently detailed to meet the obligation imposed by s 160(1)(b). Section 25D of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) provides that, where another Act requires that a Tribunal give written reasons for its decisions ""the instrument giving the reasons shall also set out the findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based"". As already noted there is authority to support an affirmative answer to this question. It is to be found in the Victorian Supreme Court's decision in the State Electricity Commission case. Authority is also to be found in decisions of this Court. In Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 , a Full Court held that a failure to give adequate reasons constitutes an error of law justifying the setting aside of an administrative decision. See also Muralidharan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 62 FCR 402 ; Preston v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2004) 39 AAR 177 at 184; Hill v Repatriation Commission [2004] FCA 832 ; (2004) 207 ALR 470 at 474; and, most recently, Civil Aviation Safety Authority v Central Aviation Pty Ltd [2009] FCAFC 137.

No order was sought by Mr Kennedy, in the course of the present appeal, requiring the Panel to provide reasons which satisfied its statutory obligations. This decision was, no doubt, influenced, in part at least, by the fact that one of the two members of the Panel who made the decision (Mr Baston) is no longer a Panel member. Had a mandatory order been made, the Panel probably could not have complied with it because the reasons given must be those of the decision-makers and not their successors: cf State Electricity Commission at 86.

The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal under s 44, but is also the subject matter of the appeal itself: see TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178 per Gummow J. The Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for pure questions of law to be identified and for them to appear in the notice of appeal in order for the Court to be able to entertain an appeal: see, for example, Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524; Birdseye at 324-325; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 at 300-302; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at 526-527; Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 ; (2006) 155 FCR 101 at 104-106; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 253-7.

Case614,Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74,"contended that the plain language of s 27 requires the average of "" all sequences of permits to be used"". It submitted that the word ""all"" is to be given work to do and the language does not allow or permit a construction that means less than the total number of permits. The ordinary meaning of the word ""all"" is ""the whole amount, quantity or extent of"". It does not mean less than the total. It does not admit of the construction advanced by Mr Kennedy that only a subset of the permits, those that were ""active"" in a certain period, should be used to calculate the average. Mr Kennedy had invited the Court to read words into s 27 such that only ""active"" permits were to be taken into consideration. In such circumstances, it must be possible for the Court to state with certainty what the additional words were that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament, had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law: see Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74 at 105. To seek to qualify the word ""all"" by the word ""active"" introduces ambiguity. The word ""active"" is not defined in the Management Plan. AFMA submitted that Mr Kennedy proceeded on an assumption that the Management Plan evinces an intention to maximise the allocation for those who consider themselves active fishers. Such an assumption is inconsistent with the language of the provisions, the portion of the formula which is based on permit value and with a choice of a particular qualifying period. AFMA rejected the significance which Mr Kennedy attached to the words ""catch"" and ""set"". Catch describes the product of fishing, rather than the activity of fishing. The words ""catch"" and ""set"" do not assist in limiting the class of permit-holders in ""all sequences of that kind"". The construction advanced by Mr Kennedy also ignored the definitions of ""old longline permit"" in s 20 of the Management Plan, which does not focus on activity under the permits, but the instrument which authorises fishing. The context and purpose of s 27 favour the construction advanced by AFMA which was accepted, without elaboration, by the Panel. Section 27 must be read in the context of the Management Plan as a whole. The Management Plan reflects policy choices on the allocation of commercial fishing rights, in relation to a finite resource. These choices are embodied in the formula in s 26. The phrase ""all sequences of that kind"" must be construed in this context.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.087,0.014,0.899,0.9769,6.34615

Case620,Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378,"Payne noted Mrs Bogdan's evidence that her father-in-law produced the draft plan and ultimately the plan was taken to Igor Designs for a final plan to be prepared. Magistrate Payne noted that Mr Bogdan did not give evidence and this was unhelpful as he was, according to Mrs Bogdan's evidence, one of the persons who drew up the plan. Magistrate Payne found it unhelpful that no evidence was called from anyone from Igor Designs. Her Honour referred to ss 10 , 14 , 31 and 36 of the Copyright Act and placed reliance upon paras [38], [41], [42], [44], [49] and [55] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 78 ; (2004) 61 IPR 378 (Moore J agreeing). Magistrate Payne noted those paragraphs as they contain a statement of principles that, in her Honour's view, governed the resolution of the case. At those paragraphs, Wilcox and Lindgren JJ note these principles. Magistrate Payne also referred to [111] of the reasons for judgment of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood in which their Honours said this: If there is to be a finding of reproduction of a substantial part of a work, the substantial part should be identified . His Honour referred to ""the overall design and combination of features"" but gives no further detail . His Honour did not attempt to identify any part of the Baltimore as being a qualitatively substantial part of the Baltimore in the sense discussed at [47] [56] above. With respect we think his Honour erred in this regard. Likewise, ""striking similarity"", without more , does not necessarily mean that there has been a reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the plan of a project home. The similarity referred to may have been that of common ideas . [emphasis added] Her Honour then applied those principles to the evidence before noting that a plan for a project home is partly functional reflecting ""reasonable proximities"" that would not be a ""substantial part"" of a house plan regarded as an artistic work. Her Honour made this finding at p 10 of her reasons: If seen in isolation, a comparison of the Bogdan plan and the Jennings Cortona and Verona plans shows there are striking similarities. Taking up the notion of a requirement on the part of Jennings, in order to discharge its onus, to show more than striking similarities, so as to establish reproduction of the work either as to the whole work or as to a substantial part, Magistrate Payne said this: The footprint of the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Cortona plan are similar, although there are differences. There is also similarity between the Bogdan plan and the AV Jennings Verona plan, and again there are differences, and I say this noting that the Bogdan plan was a mirror reverse of the AV Jennings plans. There is a similarity between the arrangement of the rooms and the footprint of the buildings, although all three are different from each other in some respects. These differences include a different floor plan and different roof line. However, it is not the footprint or floor plan alone the plaintiff complains of. The plaintiff says it is the footprint with the original or distinguishing feature of displayed walls and the higher ceilings. [emphasis added] Magistrate Payne then expressed the view set out in para 2 quoted below, which resonates with the reservation expressed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in the last sentence of [111] in Tamawood : I note also that Mr and Mrs Bogdan did little to assist me other than to say that Mrs Bogdan in her evidence had never heard of AV Jennings and had never seen one of their plans and she said she had not seen one of their homes until she was contacted by AV Jennings. ... However, despite this little assistance the onus rests on the plaintiff in this matter. When considering all of those similarities and dissimilarities which I have done and then, in applying the law, I do not consider that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proof. I find that the displayed walls and raised ceiling to be that of a common idea and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the AV Jennings Verona plan or Cortona plan by either or both of the first or second defendant. [emphasis added] Consideration of the issues on appeal As to subconscious copying, Willmer LJ noted in Francis Day &amp; Hunter at p 613 that, ""if subconscious copying is to be found, there must be proof (or at least a strong inference) of de facto familiarity with the work alleged to be copied"". In the absence of any direct evidence of use of or access to the Jennings plan in suit, the causal link can be established by inference. The greater the degree of objective similarity between the two plans, the more likely it is that an inference of actual use might be drawn ( S W Hart &amp; Co (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 472; Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309 per Heerey, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ). Exact copying is rarely the conduct in controversy. Normally an inference is sought to be drawn in the face of quantitative features of the plan in suit, present in the plan under challenge, or by correspondence with a substantial part qualitatively of the plaintiff's plan, or both. If the contention is that a substantial part of the plan in suit has been taken, a question of ""fact and degree"" arises ( Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd v Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 912 per Weinberg J at [71]) and the ""protected element may arise out of a combination of elements, any one of which considered individually might not qualify as sufficiently original to attract copyright"" ( Inform Design , per Weinberg J at [71] [emphasis added]). An allegation of substantial reproduction of the work by reproduction of a substantial part will be made out if what is taken is an essential or material part of the work in suit. The phrase ""substantial part"" refers to the quality of that taken and the importance it bears to the work as a whole ( Tamawood v Henley Arch at [50], [52] and [54]; Dixon Investments Pty Ltd v Hall 18 IPR 490 at 494 per Lockhart, Spender and Ryan JJ; Autodesk Inc. v Dyason [No. 2] [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 per Mason CJ at 305). It may be that a particular orientation and layout of rooms which draws a user through a structure in a particular way is an essential or material part of a plan ( Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 161 ALR 503 at [74] ). Essentiality is a question of fact and degree. In Tamawood at [111], Wilcox and Lindgren JJ (Moore J agreeing) noted that striking similarities however may not be enough in circumstances where the plaintiff has failed to identify the ""substantial part"" reproduced and has put its case on the footing of the ""overall design and combination of features but gives no further detail "". In such circumstances, their Honours noted that substantial similarities may simply be referable to ""common ideas"". Magistrate Payne found that splayed walls and raised ceilings are a ""common idea"" and not sufficient to sustain a conclusion of reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of either the Verona plan or the Cortona plan by either respondent. The evidence before Magistrate Payne did not establish the notion that angled walls are a common idea. It is true that the Jennings plans, the Bogdan plan and the Dixon plan exhibit elevated ceilings. However, the conclusion reached by Magistrate Payne did not take into account the particular combination of features reflected at [61] to [65] of these reasons, the evidence of Mr Deshon concerning the evolution of the Bogdan plan as a contended progression from the Canberra plan and the evidence in relation to the features of Annexure C (that is, the elements of [61] to [69]). The evidence that supports the conclusion of striking similarities based upon the identified combination of precise features makes it clear that the combination cannot be described as commonplace or simply a common idea. Taken separately, the notion of elevated ceilings may not suggest actual use of a Jennings plan. The adoption, by itself, of angled walls at 15 degrees ""off the right angled rib"" might not be sufficient to suggest actual use although the evidence suggests that such a feature is an essential or material feature. The combination of those two features adds incremental weight to the notion of objective similarity suggesting use. The combination of those features together with a floor plan exhibiting substantial similarity in orientation and layout of rooms further supports an inference of use. The expert evidence casting doubt on the proffered explanation of the origin of the Bogdan plan adds further weight to the inference as does Mr Deshon's evidence that the magazine photograph (Exhibit 6) would not lead him to a design of elevated flat ceilings had the photograph been produced to him as a starting point for a design of the rooms and ceilings in a new house, reflecting the design depicted in the photograph. Accordingly, her Honour in reaching the finding as to a ""common idea"" did not take into account all of the evidence. Moreover, the notion that something more must be shown is put in proper context by their Honours in Tamawood . As their Honours noted, that case concerned circumstances where the plaintiff had failed to identify the substantial part said to be reproduced and had put its case on the basis of overall design and a combination of features in circumstances where no detail had been given. That is not this case. It follows therefore that the evidence supports an inference that the Bogdan plan evolved through the use of either of the Jennings Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 or the Cortona 290 (as the embodiment of the combination of features identified and relied upon by the appellant). The question that remains is whether the evidence supports an inference of actual use by either or both of the respondents. Mrs Bogdan gave the evidence described earlier in these reasons which led to a finding of fact and a finding of credit ([50] of these reasons) in her favour. Magistrate Payne accepted her evidence entirely and especially her evidence that she had not seen a Jennings plan and did not have any knowledge that the Bogdan plan was a copy of any Jennings plan. That finding was plainly open on the evidence and counsel for Jennings accepted that such a finding was open to her Honour. It follows therefore that Mrs Bogdan did not make actual use of any Jennings plan in either formulating her ideas or contributing those ideas to her husband and/or Mr Florien Bogdan and there is no basis for disturbing those findings. However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was an author of Annexure C to Exhibit 4 and contributed together with Mr Florien Bogdan to the draft drawings. Mr Florien Bogdan produced Annexure D1 which was given to Igor Designs to produce Annexure E. Mr Bogdan, by his submissions, says that it is apparent from the transcript that he made statements throughout the proceeding that illustrate the nature of the evidence he would have given had Magistrate Payne made it plain to him that an adverse inference might arise should he not give evidence and those statements are set out at pp 26, 33, 35, 36, 62, 74 to 76 and 84 and 85 of the transcript. However, even if an assumption is made that the statements at those pages of the transcript ought to be treated as, in effect, oral evidence, the statements do not answer the conclusion open on the totality of the evidence that authors of the Bogdan plan used either the Verona 245 plan, the Cortona 245 plan or the Cortona 290 plan (as the embodiment in final form of the features in those plans and the plan in suit) in bringing into existence the Bogdan plan with its combination of features evident in the Cortona 290 plan. It may be that an inference is open that either Mr Bogdan used a Jennings plan and reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant or alternatively, Mr Florien Bogdan did so. Alternatively, an inference might be found that both men so used the plan. It seems likely as a matter of inference from all the evidence and particularly that of Mrs Bogdan, that Mr Florien Bogdan as a carpenter who had previously built eight houses, used a Jennings plan and thus reproduced the combined features relied upon by the appellant. However, the evidence of Mrs Bogdan makes it plain that Mr Bogdan was responsible for Annexure C and was a contributory author to the drawings (see [44] to [48] of these reasons). Mrs Bogdan referred to eight drawings in all in the evolution of the Bogdan plan, although only those drawings annexed to Exhibit 4 were produced in evidence. It follows, that Magistrate Payne erred by failing to find use of the appellant's work and reproduction in a material form of that work in suit, as against the respondent, Mr Tiberiu Bogdan. It follows that the order of the Court below dismissing the appellant's claim against Mr Tiberiu Bogdan is to be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff below. The second question that arises is the assessment of damages. The Court below did not assess nor make findings as to the quantum of the plaintiff's damage. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court to do so. Damages",Criminal Case,Murder,0.071,0.026,0.903,0.9985,6.44975
Case621,S W Hart &amp; Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466,"application of the law of copyright to project homes gives rise to special difficulty as the drawing of plans for project homes involves a mixture of the use of familiar ideas based on objects in the real world and many other project homes and plans for them, on the one hand; and the labour, skill and judgment of an author in combining and expressing those ideas in an original work on the other. The more simple and straightforward the work, the closer the similarity must be for infringement to be found. The notion of reproduction involves resemblance to the owner's work and actual use of that work ( S W Hart &amp; Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 472 per Gibbs CJ), or put another way, what is required is ""a sufficient degree of objective similarity between the two works and ... some causal connection between [the two works]"" ( Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron (1963) 1 Ch. 587 at p 614 per Willmer LJ). Causal connection and objective similarity are components of reproduction of the work in a material form. Causal connection might be inferred from access to the plan in suit and objective similarity between that work and the plan said to infringe. Too much can be made of the distinction between the work and a substantial part of it. The notion of substantial part may be found most useful where particular quantitatively small parts of the work in suit, are taken. Can it be said that a quantitatively small part is, for identified reasons given in evidence, nevertheless a substantial part of the work? The ultimate question is not infringement of the part but infringement of the whole . Whether there has been infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part taken be considered in relation to the work as a whole.

Causal connection and objective similarity are components of reproduction of the work in a material form. Causal connection might be inferred from access to the plan in suit and objective similarity between that work and the plan said to infringe. Too much can be made of the distinction between the work and a substantial part of it.

The ultimate question is not infringement of the part but infringement of the whole . Whether there has been infringement of the whole requires that the originality of the part taken be considered in relation to the work as a whole. The question is whether the part is an ""essential or material"" feature of the whole. There is no doubt that Jennings bears the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the respondents made actual use of the work in suit and having used the work, they brought into existence a plan that either takes a substantial part of the plan in suit, shown to be an essential or material feature of the whole (although perhaps a quantitatively small part) or takes substantially the whole plan, viewed quantitatively, assuming that an exact copy of the plan in suit has not been made. As to the last matter, no such claim is made. In this case, actual use is sought to be established as an inference arising out of contended striking similarities between the two plans. Those striking similarities then speak to reproduction of the plan in suit and thus infringement. In Francis Day &amp; Hunter Ltd v Bron , Willmer LJ at p 614 noted, apart from the observations mentioned at [54] of these reasons, these further matters: (3) Where there is a substantial degree of objective similarity, this of itself will afford prima facie evidence to show that there is a causal connection between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' work; at least it is a circumstance from which the inference may be drawn. (4) The fact that the defendant denies that he consciously copied affords some evidence to rebut the inference of causal connection arising from the objective similarity, but is in no way conclusive.

Case628,New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345,"Bogdan says that if the respondents had agreed to pay a licence fee to Jennings of $20,000.00, it would follow that Jennings would have no claim for the construction profit as the respondents would not have engaged Jennings to do the work. Mrs Bogdan says that conversely, if an assumption is made that Jennings would have been engaged to construct the respondents' house, there would be no licence fee. More fundamentally, Mrs Bogdan says that Jennings has not suffered any loss of profit based on construction because ""we weren't intending to hire A V Jennings to build our house"". Mrs Bogdan said that she had obtained advice from lawyers who advised her that on the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore [1998] FCA 345 , per Burchett J, the appropriate fee for use of a project home drawing was found to be $750.00 and that the case is authority for the proposition that no claim for loss of profit can be sustained in the face of evidence that the infringing respondent would not have engaged the plaintiff to construct the home. Mrs Bogdan says: This is exactly the case here. There is no evidence or even suggestion that the respondents would have engaged Jennings to construct the house in question and indeed such a claim is not even alleged in the statement of claim. More generally, Mrs Bogdan in making the point that the respondents are not project home builders or in the business of building houses, said this: ... to close, we say that we're not business. We're not intending to make business out of our home. We built it for us. We're not builders. We've got an owner/builder permit to do our own home. Mrs Bogdan referred to the authority of New England Country Homes Pty Limited v Bradley Moore (supra) and observations made by Burchett J. In that case, Burchett J considered a claim for compensatory damages in circumstances where, like this case, the respondent ""did not construct a house for sale, but as a home to live in"" (p 7). His Honour at p 8 referred to a number of authorities that support the proposition that the Court may adopt as a measure of damages where it thinks the course appropriate, a fair fee for the use of the plan the subject of the infringement. Burchett J noted that the applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of the profit it would have earned by the sale of a kit for the construction of the respondents' house. However, the evidence demonstrated that the respondent would never have purchased a kit home from the applicant ""under any circumstances"" and thus the infringement did not cause the loss of profit on the sale of a kit home. The applicant sought an assessment of damages on the basis of a licence fee of $6,000.00 for the use of the kit home construction plans. His Honour referred to evidence that suggested a licence fee based on a fee paid to a draftsman of $535.00 was a more likely fair licence fee and thus awarded the applicant damages of $750.00, as mentioned in submissions by Mrs Bogdan. In this case, it is equally clear that had Jennings quoted to the respondents an amount of $198,550.00 (including GST) as the price for the construction of the Bogdan home including the variations to the plan the subject of the amount of $16,424.00 mentioned in the evidence of Mr Henesey-Smith, the Bogdans would not have accepted that quote. Jennings would not have undertaken the project and would not have derived the construction profit or any profit. Accordingly, in assessing the damages on that footing, I take into account these matters. In this case, the respondents, like the respondent in New England Country Homes , chose to devise a plan for and then construct a home to live in rather than a house for sale. In doing so, Mr Bogdan engaged in conduct of reproducing the appellant's plan in a material form. There is no suggestion that either respondent will engage in any further infringing conduct. Nor is there any evidence that Jennings has suffered a diminution in its revenue by reason of this transactional act of infringement. Moreover, the evidence demonstrates that Jennings would not have derived any profit from the project as the respondents would not have either paid a licence fee to or contracted with Jennings for the design and construction of their home. Nevertheless, the fact that the respondents would not have contracted with Jennings is not an answer to the Jennings' claim for damages suffered as a result of the infringement. It is necessary to formulate the damages referable to the act of infringement by attempting to disaggregate the bundle of services Jennings supplies to a client so as to isolate the best estimate of damages possible on the evidence available as a measure of the appellant's loss directly related to infringement. In undertaking that exercise, it is not appropriate to bring into account the cost of the additions to the Bogdan plan not reflected in the Cortona 290 . Jennings says that the direct cost of design and construction of a Cortona 290 in January 2004 was $118,912.00. A margin of 25% based on those foundation costs would amount to $29,728.00. Jennings, of course, says that its 25% margin is struck on the gross turnover value excluding GST which in respect of the Cortona 290 excluding the Bogdan additions seems to be $164,076.00 representing a margin of $41,019.00 on the preferred method adopted by Jennings. That method of calculating a margin on the turnover value excluding GST is a calculation of its design and construction profit. Damages ought not to be calculated on that footing. An examination of these approaches to the calculation of profit is simply an indication of the net loss Jennings might have derived had it undertaken the project (leaving aside the variations for this purpose). One way of forming a view of the contribution of the copyright in the plan to that profit is to appreciate the aggregation of services which give rise to the profit and to then disaggregate those services and apportion some part of the profit to the use of the plan as an analogue of loss suffered by Jennings by reason of the use by Mr Bogdan of the Jennings plan as joint author with Mr Florien Bogdan. The profit calculation is simply a base starting point. Doing the best I can on the available evidence which is very limited, I estimate the contribution of the copyright in the plan at about 10%. The vast majority of the profit is, no doubt, referable to the quantities of materials supplied and the construction, supervision and completion of the home itself. On that footing, the damages would range between $2,972.00 and $4,101.00. It seems to me that the appropriate amount is the average of the two namely, $3,536.00. There is no basis for an award of exemplary damages.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.105,0.093,0.801,0.9469,6.299149999999999

There is, understandably, no evidence of a discounted cash flow valuation of the copyright as a capital asset nor, equally understandably, any evidence of any diminution, by reason of the infringement, in the capacity of Jennings to derive revenue by exploiting the copyright work, that is, by using the plan and constructing houses representing a three-dimensional reproduction of the plan, for clients. In this case, the respondents built a single house as their residential dwelling. They are not project home builders and they are not in the business of repetitious infringing conduct. Since there is no demonstrated impact on the exploitation revenues Jennings derives from the use of the Cortona 290 plan, there is very likely to be no corresponding impact on the value of the copyright as an incorporeal right.

In Autodesk v Cheung , Wilcox J did not apply the licence fee approach to the assessment of damages because his Honour could not draw the inference, on the facts of that case, that the respondent, presented with a choice between paying a licence fee or not using the work, would have paid the licence fee. It was simply not a likely event. Similarly, Tamberlin J took the view on the facts before his Honour in Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. &amp; Anor v Luckins (1996) 34 IPR 504 at 509 that a licence was unrealistic. His Honour observed at 509: In my view, the licence fee approach is not appropriate in a situation where it is clear that there never would have been a licence granted by the applicants because of the disruption such a licence would inflict on the applicants' basic strategic marketing timetable in Australia. The evidence in this case does not suggest any element of a competitive threat by the respondent, Mr Bogdan, to the activities of Jennings nor is there any suggestion of any disruption to the applicant's activities manifest in the class of case reflected in the decisions in Autodesk v Cheung , Columbia Pictures v Luckins and Eagle Rock v Caisley . Equally clearly, the element of disruption was the factual foundation upon which their Honours came to the conclusion that the applicants in each case would not have granted a licence. It is clear in this case that had a licence been sought by the respondents from Jennings it would either not have been granted or alternatively a licence fee of $20,000.00 might have been nominated by Jennings. That possibility is at least consistent with the letter of demand and the pleading. Nevertheless, had Jennings sought a licence fee from the respondents of $20,000.00, plainly enough, the respondents would not have taken up that licence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.058,0.062,0.88,-0.3979,1.61135

Case636,Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. &amp; Anor v Luckins (1996) 34 IPR 504,"Autodesk v Cheung , Wilcox J did not apply the licence fee approach to the assessment of damages because his Honour could not draw the inference, on the facts of that case, that the respondent, presented with a choice between paying a licence fee or not using the work, would have paid the licence fee. It was simply not a likely event. Similarly, Tamberlin J took the view on the facts before his Honour in Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. &amp; Anor v Luckins (1996) 34 IPR 504 at 509 that a licence was unrealistic. His Honour observed at 509: In my view, the licence fee approach is not appropriate in a situation where it is clear that there never would have been a licence granted by the applicants because of the disruption such a licence would inflict on the applicants' basic strategic marketing timetable in Australia. In that case, Tamberlin J was addressing the assessment of damages arising out of the importation into Australia by the respondent of copies of films distributed on laser disks in the United States by Columbia Pictures . In that context, Tamberlin J rejected the utility of the licence fee approach. A similar view was taken in Eagle Rock v Caisley which concerned the assessment of damages arising out of the sale of DVD copies of an unauthorised recording of a live performance by Eric Clapton and his band. In Eagle Rock at [12], Tamberlin J said this: ... I do not consider that Eagle would, if requested, have granted a licence to Caisley or that Caisley would have paid the licence fee if he was given the choice between so doing or not using the copyright work. The two parties were in direct competition. The evidence in this case does not suggest any element of a competitive threat by the respondent, Mr Bogdan, to the activities of Jennings nor is there any suggestion of any disruption to the applicant's activities manifest in the class of case reflected in the decisions in Autodesk v Cheung , Columbia Pictures v Luckins and Eagle Rock v Caisley . Equally clearly, the element of disruption was the factual foundation upon which their Honours came to the conclusion that the applicants in each case would not have granted a licence. It is clear in this case that had a licence been sought by the respondents from Jennings it would either not have been granted or alternatively a licence fee of $20,000.00 might have been nominated by Jennings. That possibility is at least consistent with the letter of demand and the pleading. Nevertheless, had Jennings sought a licence fee from the respondents of $20,000.00, plainly enough, the respondents would not have taken up that licence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.068,0.057,0.876,0.7594,5.649900000000001
Case637,Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554,"the formulation of Lord Wright in Sutherland has been described as ""no more than a convenient label for the various ways of assessing damages which are available in any particular case"" ( Australasian Performing Rights Association v Grebo Trading Co. Pty Ltd (1978) 23 ACTR 30 per Blackburn CJ at 31) and the question to be answered is, what loss has Jennings suffered as a result of the infringement of its copyright? ( Interfirm at 446) As to the general principles concerning the assessment of damages for breach of copyright, see Autodesk v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 474 477; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 111 ALR 269 at 285; Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137 and Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554. Jennings contends that it does not licence its copyright to enable third party construction to occur. It keeps its copyright in a Jennings safe harbour and uses it solely in its own construction activity. Therefore, it is said, Jennings ought not to be treated in an analogous position to an architect who might, by reason of the nature of the professional work an architect undertakes, be subject to an implied licence of the copyright in a work produced in connection with particular projects. Nor, it is said, should the hypothetical ""construct"" of a notional willing licensor and licensee be adopted as the framework for determining a surrogate measure of damages by reference to a licence fee. The pleading claims damages on the alternative bases of either a fee for use of the plan or lost profits in the construction of the Bogdan home.

Case643,SZGQI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1461,"On appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision ( SZGQI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1461) the appellant, who appears in person, raises the following grounds of appeal: 1. The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the Appellant was denied procedural fairness by the Second Respondent and/or did not receive a fair hearing as required by section 425 of the Migration Act 1958 . 2. The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the decision of the Second Respondent was affected by apprehended bias. 3. The Federal Magistrate erred by refusing to contact witness and/or to advise or allow the Appellant of his right to call witness in circumstances where the evidence was readily available and was of critical importance. The grounds are substantially similar to those raised before the Federal Magistrate in relation to the Tribunal's decision. 4 Before Lloyd-Jones FM the appellant raised a number of particulars of the grounds relating to the conduct of the hearing before the Tribunal. The appellant argued that the Tribunal hearing and decision making process were inadequate in that he was not accorded procedural fairness or given a real and meaningful opportunity to represent himself. Further, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal member did not bring an impartial mind to the issues or that the member had a preconceived view (at [12]). Many of these claims were directed to the method of questioning and the adequacy of interpreting. Counsel for the appellant acknowledged there was an overlap between the particulars of the first and second grounds (at [12]). 5 His Honour had the benefit of extensive written submissions and the appellant was represented by counsel. After the hearing, Lloyd-Jones FM listened to the tapes of the Tribunal hearing and read the transcript (at [21], [25]). He considered in some detail the matters raised in the particulars and in the written and oral submissions and found that there had been no denial of procedural fairness nor any evidence to support a claim of apprehended bias (at [13]-[33]). 6 The appellant makes no submissions on those aspects of his Honour's reasons. I have reviewed those reasons for this finding and do not consider that his Honour erred. 7 The appellant also asserts that he had been ill at the time of the Tribunal hearing and suffered from depression in a way that affected his ability to participate in the hearing. There is evidence of a medical report before the Tribunal but that report does not mention a reduced ability of the appellant to attend and participate in the hearing. The appellant could not point to any other reference in the material before the Tribunal to suggest that the Tribunal should have been aware of the alleged state of his health. He said that he told his legal advisers but could point to no reference to the state of his health in any submissions to, or correspondence with, the Tribunal nor in the transcript of the hearing. I am not satisfied that there was any denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal in this regard. 8 The appellant says that the Tribunal did not believe him. That engages merits review which is not a matter for this Court. 9 The appellant asserts that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence that he submitted from Amnesty International. There is reference to that evidence in the Tribunal's decision and in the Federal Magistrate's reasons (at [32]). It is described by the Tribunal as providing a chronology of correspondence in relation to the appellant's case and evidence of his political profile and his family's profile as business people in danger of being targeted as class enemies by Maoists. The underlying facts of the appellant's personal position were accepted by the Tribunal. There is no basis for a finding of jurisdictional error in respect of this evidence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.077,0.872,-0.9348,-0.2437999999999998

I am satisfied that the respondent took all reasonable steps. The land was put up at a properly advertised auction, and then remained on the market for some 15 months, during which time it only attracted one offer, for which it was sold. I am satisfied that the price was a reasonable price, and in fact was at or about market value at the time. I reject valuation evidence given on behalf of Mr Upton by Mr Daryll Timms. He valued the land at 27 November 2000 at $175,000 ""for security purposes"" but on the basis that ""a six lot Council approved development would be completed by Mr Upton himself"".

Case646,Fountain Meat Sales Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401,"Sealy on behalf of the respondent sought an order for costs on an indemnity basis. He referred to a number of authorities, including Fountain Meat Sales Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401 where Woodward J said that such an order was appropriate where an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the party, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success. It is not necessary to show that the claim was brought for some collateral purpose or is an abuse of process. In my opinion this was a hopeless case, and should have been recognised as such from the outset. Given the initial auction and the time the property was on the market, there was no arguable basis for contending that the sale to Mr Patmore was improper. On that premise, the respondent could not have been expected to act other than in the way it did. At the heart of Mr Upton's case is, I suspect, a belief that notwithstanding he was a mortgagor in default he had some kind of right of first refusal before the mortgagee could sell. This is a misconception. There should be an award of indemnity costs.

Case649,Lott v JBW &amp; Friends Pty Ltd (2000) 76 SASR 105,"In dealing with this issue the learned Magistrate discussed Lott v JBW &amp; Friends Pty Ltd (2000) 76 SASR 105. The work there in question was a graphic bar with the words ""Opera in the Outback"". The report does not contain a reproduction. Mullighan J held that it was a ""drawing"". His Honour said at [14] The graphic designer had to create a design and make choices about the layout, font, colour and dimensions of each part of the design. Having perused the graphic ... I do not regard it as so simple as to deny copyright. ... The selection of the font from a computer program is no less creative than manual drawing ... 23 In the present case her Honour, correctly in my view, pointed out at [29] that Lott is not authority for the proposition that anything a graphic designer prepares is a drawing. 24 The same point was made by Mr Minahan, counsel for the respondents, in his written submissions. The submissions, he said, involved the use of a computer and selection of typeface and decisions about layout and presentation including headings and indentation. The same could be said for a newspaper. However neither the submissions nor a newspaper would be regarded as a drawing. 25 Her Honour adopted the statement in Ricketson, S The Law of Intellectual Property, Copyright Designs and Confidential Information , at par 7.365: Essentially, a drawing is a two-dimensional work in which shapes and images are depicted by lines, often without colouring. 26 I would agree that this is the ordinary meaning of the term ""drawing"". The Macquarie Dictionary gives us several definitions of the noun ""drawing"": ... 2. representation by lines; delineation of form without reference to colour. 3. a sketch, plan, or design, esp one made with pen, pencil, or crayon. 27 In the context of the visual arts, the traditional distinction has been between paintings, which are coloured, and drawings, which are monotone, usually, but not always, black upon white. The statutory definition, particularly by its inclusion of maps, makes it clear that for the purposes of the Act something may be a drawing notwithstanding that it is coloured. However, the essence of a drawing remains the concept of a representation of some object by a pictorial line.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.046,0.015,0.939,0.8997,6.11795

It is discussed at [34]-[37] of the judgment. Mr Minahan objected to this late amendment, citing the decision of the High Court in Metwally v University of Wollongong (No 2) [1985] HCA 28 ; (1985) 60 ALR 68 at 71: It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances it would contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case has been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. 32 The application to amend should be refused, primarily for the reason that the proposed amendment lacks arguable merit. The notion of compilation involves a collecting and putting together or arranging or organising of disparate data. That is not the case with the appellant's label. It is simply a photograph and a description of an object. It conveys the one message. 33 The appellant's case was pleaded in the common law tort of passing off as well as alleged contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).

The appellant claims the gross profit on an equivalent number of sales it says it has lost. 57 There were 676 such sales by the respondents. The lowest profit margin for the appellant, being that on its small photo boxes, was $5.45. The resultant figure is $3684.20.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.086,0.11,0.804,-0.6249,0.8368500000000001
Case657,I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109,"In my view, the appellant's approach is a realistic one. The competing products were presented side by side to consumers. As already noted, the effect of the offending packaging was likely to induce consumers into thinking that they were getting the same product from the same source but would be saving money by not having to pay for more elaborate packaging, which they did not need. The misleading and deceptive conduct only has to be one among a number of causes which contributes to a consumer decision harmful to a plaintiff. As Gleeson CJ said in I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [33] : In most business transactions resulting in financial loss there are multiple causes of the loss. The statutory purpose would be defeated if the remedy under s 82 were restricted to loss of which the contravening conduct was the sole cause. 60 While the appellant's claim is based on gross profit lost, that seems a practical measure in the circumstances of this case. It is a modest claim because it assumes that all sales lost were of the small box, which had the lowest margin. It would be an artificial exercise to attempt to calculate some proportion of that profit which represented savings of fixed costs. This case was properly brought in the Federal Magistrates Court, a jurisdiction which is expected to operate as informally as possible: Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) ss 3(2)(a) and 42 . In a case of this nature parties should not feel they have to engage forensic accountants and similar experts. 61 The appeal will be allowed and the judgment below set aside. In lieu thereof there will be judgment for the appellant against the respondents (the liability of the first respondent under s 79(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act was not in dispute). The amount of that judgment will be $3684.20 plus appropriate interest under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 62 There remain the questions of costs. As already mentioned, the learned Magistrate made an order for indemnity costs. The respondents had made Calderbank offers as follows: &#8226; 5 April 2006: an undertaking to cease selling products with the offending packaging &#8226; 27 April 2006: the undertaking, $3775 for costs and $1200 damages &#8226; 19 May 2006: the undertaking, $4331 for costs and $2706 damages &#8226; 2 June 2006: the undertaking, $4331 for costs and $9000 damages. (The time for compliance with this offer was extended on two occasions). 63 I direct that the appellant within seven days file written submissions as to interest and costs and that the respondent file answering submissions within seven days thereafter.

Case658,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507,"Federal Magistrate Cameron found that there had been no jurisdictional error on the part of the reconstituted Tribunal (at [21]). His Honour observed that the appellant only identified, in support of an inference of apprehended bias, the second s 424A letter and the Tribunal's ultimate findings (at [14]). His Honour observed that absent a response by the appellant to that letter, there was nothing upon which to base a conclusion that the Tribunal's mind was closed. His Honour commented further that it was unsurprising that, in the absence of a response from the appellant, the matters raised in the second s 424A letter ultimately formed at least part of the reasons why the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision and the two coincided. His Honour also noted that the fact that the second s 424A letter disclosed a predisposition on the part of the Tribunal is not indicative of a closed mind (at [15] citing Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [71] - [72] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J).",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.107,0.018,0.875,0.9535,6.2482500000000005
Case659,SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291,"As to the alleged breach of s 424A of the Act, the information with regard to letters from members of the Awami League was contained in advice received from the Australian High Commission in Dhaka. That information was put to the appellant for comment in the first s 424A letter sent by the first Tribunal. It was not contained in the second s 424A letter. However, as Cameron FM pointed out, the s 424A information was sent by the Tribunal to the appellant (at [17]). The fact that the first s 424A letter was sent by the first Tribunal and not the reconstituted Tribunal, does not make it any less a letter pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act for the purposes of the second hearing (at [18]). Federal Magistrate Cameron referred in this respect to SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2006) 159 FCR 291. 6 In his notice of appeal setting forth the grounds of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court the appellant raises, in effect, the same grounds as those raised before his Honour. 7 The first ground asserts error on the part of the Federal Magistrate and failure to provide relief because it is said the reconstituted Tribunal cannot rely on the first s 424A letter, sent by the first Tribunal. 8 The second ground alleges that there was a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal member had made up his mind to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time when the reconstituted Tribunal sought to comply with its obligations under s 424A of the Act. The particulars given of that ground set forth the tests to be applied in the determination of apprehended bias and an assertion that the Tribunal member had already decided to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time that the letter was sent. 9 As to the first ground, I do not see any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate or his Honour's reliance on SZEPZ . The information that formed part of the reason for decision of the reconstituted Tribunal, which it was obliged to provide to the appellant for comment, was the information as to false documents that was contained in the first s 424A letter. As such, it was available to the reconstituted Tribunal to rely upon it without further requirement that it be sent to the appellant again. Although it is for the member of the reconstituted Tribunal to provide the consideration of what would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming a decision under review, the sending of information for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act and the receipt of information for the purposes of s 424A(3)(b) does not depend on the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal ( SZEPZ at [39] [40]). 10 I also agree with his Honour's reasons for rejecting the claim of apprehended bias. No basis to support this ground has been made out. The appellant appeared before me in person assisted by an interpreter. When asked to expand upon this ground, he asserted that the Tribunal had made its decision in bad faith but was unable to provide particulars other than his wish to have the decision set aside so that he could put more information, being further material that was not before the Tribunal at the time of his decision. to the Tribunal in order to enable it to come, he said, to a different conclusion. 11 I have not discerned jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal nor error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. 12 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. The appellant is to pay the first respondent's costs.

Case664,"Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987)","My attention was drawn to Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987) by counsel for Mr Callipari. That case turned on the findings of Bryson J on the evidence. Given my findings of fact, I do not think it assists me in the resolution of this case. 45 Finally, counsel for Mr Callipari submitted in the alternative that Web Wealth has acted in a manner by which it unequivocally surrendered its security. The question was asked rhetorically; if Web Wealth held security why did it not raise the issue earlier than it did? I have considered that question when making my findings of fact. I do not consider that there is anything which indicates that Web Wealth surrendered its security, or acted in a way which amounts to a waiver of its rights to enforce the security or to an election to surrender it or not to enforce it. 46 The parties were agreed upon the appropriate form of orders if I were to reach the conclusion I have reached. I think they are appropriate. I accordingly declare that Web Wealth Pty Ltd has an interest in the fund comprising the proceeds of sale of the land described in Certificates of Title Register Book Volume 9983 Folio 505 and Volume 9593 Folio 463 (""the properties"") corresponding to the equitable mortgage in its favour created by the deposit of duplicate certificates of title by Helimount Pty Ltd in January 2005.

Case665,Adler v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 504,"for ASIC submits that the role of the SOFAC was to afford procedural fairness to Mr Gould and that what procedural fairness requires does not involve a fixed body of rules to be applied at a formulaic manner. Counsel refers to the statement by Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [37] that: Fairness is not an abstract concept. It is essentially practical. Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice. Counsel also referred to Adler v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 504 at [139] where Giles JA quoted from Greek Herald Pty Ltd v Nikolopoulos (2001) 54 NSWLR 165 at [18] where Mason P had said that ""pleadings serve the ends of justice [and] must not be permitted to assume an independent self-referential function"".",Criminal Case,Rape,0.066,0.034,0.9,0.6808,5.3508000000000004
Case666,Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201,"Tribunal, however, saw the question as being not one of requiring a different mode of delivery, but one of ensuring a sufficient margin of time to allow for any risk of mail delays. This was necessary, according to the Tribunal, in order for a liquidator ""to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way"" (at [222]), citing Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201 ( Adsett ) at 212. The Tribunal concluded that the late lodgement was the fault of Mr Gould or his staff. It described that fault as not a serious one, but said that the gravamen of Contention 6.5 was not the late posting but the charging of the late fee as an expense of the liquidation (at [223]). A separate submission made by Mr Gould was, according the Tribunal, based on Mr Gould's right of lien. There were inadequate funds in the liquidation to pay all of Mr Gould's remuneration and expenses, and he was owed many thousands of dollars in fees. His argument was that since the entire fund at the time was payable to him, the $120 was, in effect, paid to him because he would have been entitled at the time to transfer the entire fund to himself for work performed. It followed, according to Mr Gould's submission, that his choice to pay $120 of the funds to ASIC rather than to himself could not be properly the subject of criticism. The Tribunal also cited various passages from Adsett , and implied that the expenditure on the late fees was not ""reasonable"", was not ""prudently and reasonably incurred"", and was not incurred ""conformably with the duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way"" (at [228]). The Tribunal concluded its discussion of Contention 6.5 as follows (at [229]): ""While the evidence does not warrant a finding of fraud, neither does it depict a genuine misapprehension and a sincere belief that the action was justified, as the applicant submitted. His endeavours to obtain waiver of the fees suggest that he knew that he was personally responsible for them. And describing the payment as ""Lodgement fees"" in the May 1999 Form 524 was disingenuous at best. The applicant plainly knew he had something to hide and tried to hide it."" As indicated at [167] above, I do not agree that Mr Gould's endeavour to obtain a waiver was an acknowledgment of personal responsibility for the fees.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.087,0.076,0.837,0.8057,5.808949999999999
Case667,Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1986) 10 FCR 356,"Tribunal rejected a submission made by Mr Gould in reliance on Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1986) 10 FCR 356. In that case, at 381, a Full Court of this Court accepted that circumstances could arise in which it would be accurate to characterise a debit to an estate of penalty fees as a ""fraud on the creditors"", but considered that that would be so only where the penalty fees had been incurred at ""as a result of the neglect or omission of the liquidator"" (at 381). In the case before their Honours there was no evidence as to the circumstances under which the penalty fees had become payable: the fault may have lain with the liquidator or with another party or ""may have been caused by circumstances outside the control of the liquidator and his agents"" (at 381). Their Honours observed that a finding of fraud, especially against a professional person in relation to his or her professional activities, should be made only upon the basis of clear evidence and after the person concerned has had the opportunity to deal with the matter. The Tribunal distinguished Ah Toy . It considered that the Full Court was directing its attention to the trial judge's finding that the liquidator's charging the company's estate with a total of $127 for late filing fees was ""most reprehensible"" and ""a fraud on the creditors, small but important, as indicating serious impropriety"" (at 380). The Tribunal remarked (at [220]): ""It was the finding of fraud that the court set aside, not the finding that the late fee should not have been charged to the estate as such. That would depend on whose fault it was that the documents were lodged late. In this case it can only have been the applicant's."" In substance the Tribunal decided that if Mr Gould chose to rely on the post, he had to accept the risk of incurring a late filing fee ""or else allow a margin of a couple of days to guard against the risk of late delivery"" (at [221]). The Tribunal recorded Mr Gould's evidence that it was widely regarded as competent practice to mail forms to ASIC, that it was extraordinary for that course to fail and that he had not known of a prior occasion when the mail had ""failed"". The Tribunal also noted Mr Gould's evidence that to require a different mode of delivery in all cases would increase the cost to creditors, for no real benefit in nearly all cases. The Tribunal said (at [227]) that it did not think the facts warranted a finding of fraud, but nor did it think that Mr Gould was justified in treating the expense as a reasonable expense of the liquidation or as otherwise proper. Indeed, the Tribunal thought that the reasoning in Ah Toy strongly suggested the opposite.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.079,0.128,0.793,-0.9853,-0.39955000000000007

Case671,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Gould submits that the Board's decision that it was satisfied of the existence of the ground set out in s 1292(2)(d) was itself a reviewable decision, similar to the decision in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 ( Bond ) that the licensees were no longer fit and proper persons to hold broadcasting licences under s 88 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 (Cth). Counsel for Mr Gould refers to passages in the various judgments in Bond in which it was recognised that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's ""finding"" that licensees were no longer fit and proper persons to hold their licences was itself a decision under an enactment because, although it was also a step on the way to the ultimate decision whether to revoke or suspend the licence or to impose conditions, it was a decision on a matter of substance for which the statute provided as an essential preliminary to the ultimate decision: see Mason CJ at 337, 339; Brennan J at 365; Deane J at 369; Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 377. The Tribunal stated (at [31]) that it was not contested that the decision under review before the Tribunal was the Board's decision to make a suspension order as allowed for by the concluding words of s 1292(2). The Tribunal said that the reaching of a state of satisfaction that the grounds for the making of that order were made out was a step along the way to the ultimate decision and was not itself reviewable. The Tribunal also referred to Bond at 336-338 per Mason CJ. However, Mason CJ qualified his description of the position that ""ordinarily"" prevailed as mentioned above. Section 1317B(1) of the Law (and of the Act) provided that application might be made to the Tribunal for review of, relevantly, a decision made under the Law (or the Act) by the Board. It is at least clear that the Board's decision to suspend Mr Gould's registration as a liquidator was a decision made under an enactment (cf s 1292(2) of the Law and of the Act) and was reviewable by the Tribunal. I will assume, by reference to the passages from Bond referred to above, that the Board's being satisfied of any of the states of affairs referred to in s 1292(2)(d) is also a decision made under the statute, and that the Tribunal erred in stating otherwise. Nonetheless, I do not see how this avails Mr Gould, because Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A were relied on by ASIC as supporting that essential intermediate decision, as well as the ultimate decision to suspend Mr Gould's registration. The same principles must govern the question whether it was permissible for the Tribunal to entertain those Contentions, regardless of whether the Tribunal was reviewing the ultimate decision to suspend or the essential intermediate decision in the nature of the making of a finding. I do not think that there is merit in Mr Gould's first submission. Mr Gould secondly submits that an assumption by the Tribunal of jurisdiction over charges that were not previously the subject of a Board determination deprives a member of the profession of his or her right to have a ""merits review"": appeals from the Tribunal are on questions of law only (see s 44(1) of the AAT Act). The five legal principles and the authorities that Mr Gould cites in support of them are as follows: (a) ASIC must act with reasonable promptness and diligence in prosecuting charges in respect of a matter or complaint that comes to its attention: Herron v McGregor (1986) 6 NSWLR 246 at 254; Gill Herron and Gardiner v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 208A per Kirby P; R v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police ; ex parte Calveley [1986] QB 424 ( Calveley ); (b) A prosecutor will generally be permitted to have only one ""bite of the cherry"" in respect of any formal hearing of charges against a defendant in respect of a matter in issue: Walter Construction Group v Fair Trading Administrative Corporation [2005] NSWCA 65 ; (c) A decision by an administrative body or court to stay or to refuse to deal with charges on the ground that their prosecution would be unfair and oppressive to the defendant may prevent them from being re-agitated, even if the fresh proceeding could be conducted without unfairness to the defendant, by analogy to principles which inform the rule against double jeopardy or as a species of double jeopardy: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 396-398 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 58 per Deane J; Gill v Walton (1991) 25 NSWLR 190 at 200-202 per Gleeson CJ, at 206-207 per Kirby P; (d) Allegations which, owing to the delay in their being prosecuted, may prejudice the defendant and deny him or her his right to a fair hearing, may be stayed: Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23 ; (e) If, because of the above matters or otherwise, it would be unfair or oppressive to a defendant to face the charges in question, a tribunal such as the Tribunal, is required to stay or to decline to hear the charges: Re Moline and Comcare (2003) 77 ALD 224 , [2003] AATA 827 ; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Air Services Australia (1997) 146 ALR 1 at 40-42 per Finn J; Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd v Moorehead (1912) 15 CLR 332 at 342 per Griffith CJ; Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council [1979] 1 NSWLR 537 at 558-9 per Mahoney J; SCI Operations Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (1996) 139 ALR 595 ; Greiner v Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (1992) 28 NSWLR 125.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.068,0.878,-0.9359,-0.26164999999999994
Case672,Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (2006) 59 ACSR 698 ; [2006] FCA 1438,"Law did not specify that a cap was required. In Dean-Willcocks v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board &amp; Anor (2006) 59 ACSR 698 ; [2006] FCA 1438 ( Dean-Willcocks ), however, Tamberlin J accepted that in determining whether a registered liquidator has failed to carry out or perform ""adequately and properly"" any duties or functions required by Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator for the purposes of s 1292(2)(d)(ii) , it was permissible to test performance of the registered liquidator in the office of administrator against professional standards and codes (at [21]-[34]). Moreover, his Honour held that the concept of the performance of the function of an administrator was wide enough to include the acceptance of appointment to that office (at [32]). Tamberlin J's views must apply a fortiori to s 1292(2)(d)(i) and the office of a liquidator a fortiori because an argument, based on the presence of the words ""required by an Australian law to be carried out or performed by a registered liquidator"" in para (ii) of s 1292(2)(d) , that subsection (2) refers only to legislative prescriptions (an argument rejected by his Honour) is not available in respect of para (i). ASIC's proposition was that by not including a cap or upper limit, Mr Gould had fallen short of a professional standard which was stated in the Capping provisions of the Guide and the Statement. Before the Tribunal ASIC relied on the tender of those documents unsupported by any expert testimony. The Guide and the Statement of the IPAA On 20 December 1997 the IPAA issued the Guide, called a ""Guide to Hourly Rates"", to have effect from 1 December 1997. The Guide included certain Classifications by reference to insolvency experience and Hourly Rates chargeable in respect of persons falling within the various classes. In Dean-Willcocks , two Codes of Professional Conduct issued by the IPAA and the Institute of Chartered Accounts in Australia dealt with professional independence, conflicts of interest, and disclosure of relationships that might be thought to impinge on the independence of a registered liquidator acting as administrator. Moreover, CALDB relied on evidence of an expert (Mr Lombe). The words ""or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator"" provide an alternative to the criteria that precede in subparas (i) and (ii). Paragraph (d) must, however, be read as a whole. Its criteria can be analysed as follows (I will refer only to para (i) but the same analysis applies to para (ii)): (1) failure to perform adequately and properly the duties of a liquidator; or (2) being otherwise not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator. The word ""otherwise"" shows that the provision takes it for granted that a failure of the kind described in (1) will, without more, demonstrate that the person is not a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator. Consistently with this understanding, the expression ""the duties of a liquidator"" directs attention, not to a specific duty or even to two or more specific duties, but to the duties in general of a liquidator. Of course, whether a registered liquidator has failed to perform adequately and properly the duties in general of a liquidator will be decided by reference to his or her failure to perform specific duties. Both limbs (1) and (2) call for an exercise of assessment, evaluation and judgment in relation to the registered liquidator's conduct. It is not enough, for example, in a mechanical and arithmetical way, simply to seek to identify a minimum of two failures to perform adequately and properly particular duties. Whether the Capping provisions in the Guide and the Statement were ""professional standards"" of the kind to which Tamberlin J was referring in Dean-Willcocks , depends on whether they purported to establish levels of ""adequate"" and ""proper"" performance that a registered liquidator must attain at peril of enlivening criterion (1) or criterion (2) above a serious matter. I do not think that they did. Two considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, neither Capping provision was contained in a document that purported to lay down standards of professional conduct of that kind. Second, the ambiguous and loose language of the Capping provisions themselves is not what one would expect of such a standard. The Guide purported to provide guidance, and stated that it was not to be used in every instance. These features characterised the Guide as a whole. There is no reason to exclude from them the Capping provision. I turn now to the language of the Guide's Capping provision. No doubt a professional standard of the kind contemplated by Tamberlin J in Dean-Willcocks may be attended by ambiguity. Moreover, as indicated above, I accept that in the present cases remuneration was approved prospectively. However, the loose language and uncertainty of the Capping provision of the Guide suggests that it was not intended by the IPAA to be a professional standard in the sense described. The Statement likewise does not establish a professional standard in that sense. First, it is a Statement of ""Best Practice"", not of a minimum required. As the ""Conclusion"" makes clear, the Statement was not intended to be prescriptive (see [69] above). Secondly, there are again certain ambiguities touching the Capping provision. I referred to two of these at [67] and [107] above. Whereas the Capping provision in the Guide predicated a ""resolution for remuneration"", that in the Statement predicates a ""resolution for approval of remuneration"". As in the Guide, it is unclear what the ""specified amount"" is to be a specified amount of. Mr Gould submits that in the absence of expert evidence, it was not permissible for the Tribunal to find that he had not carried out or performed his duties as liquidator of Popwing ""adequately and properly"". Mr Gould submits that this question is one of judgment, not a pure question of law, and that the answer must be informed by evidence of accepted proper practice: Mr Gould refers to Re Vouris; Epromotions Australia Pty Ltd and Relectronic-Remech Pty Ltd (in liq) [2003] NSWSC 702 ; (2003) 47 ACSR 155 at [101] and [103] Goodman v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 50 ACSR 1 at [26]; Dean-Willcocks at [24]-[26]; Albarran v Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board [2007] HCA 23 ; (2007) 231 CLR 350 at [18] , [20] and [24].",Criminal Case,Murder,0.059,0.057,0.883,0.7313,5.55455

The Tribunal said (at [30]) that its role was to determine the correct or preferable decision on the material before the Tribunal, not on the material that was before the primary decision-maker, and that the Tribunal was required to review the primary decision, not the reasons given for it, citing Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 24 ALR 577 ( Drake ) at 589, 599. The Tribunal thought that Mr Gould's submission sought to read too much into the word ""on"" in the expression ""on an application by ASIC"" in s 1292(2). The Tribunal stated (at [34]) that to confine the review before it to the grounds contained in the original application (as amended) would be a significant departure from the usual pattern of merits review under the AAT Act as analysed in Drake and succeeding cases.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.071,0.011,0.919,0.8689,5.98415

Case676,Green v United States [1957] USSC 146 ; 355 US 184 (1957),"Gould addresses an argument relied on by ASIC before the Tribunal and accepted by it, namely, that because it was Mr Gould who chose to apply to the Tribunal for review of the Board's decision, ASIC should not be prevented from re-agitating the charges rejected by the Board. Mr Gould submits that the Tribunal should have followed the approach of the United States Supreme Court in Green v United States [1957] USSC 146 ; 355 US 184 (1957). In that case, the defendant faced alternative charges of first and second degree murder. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of second degree murder and did not return a verdict on the first charge. The defendant successfully appealed and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial. At the retrial, the defendant was again charged with first degree murder. The trial judge ruled that the rule against double jeopardy did not apply. The defendant was convicted of first degree murder. He appealed. The opinion of the Supreme Court was given by Black J who said at 187-188: ... The State, with all its resources and power, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that, even though innocent, he may be found guilty. Later, at 193, Black J stated: Whatever may be said for the notion of continuing jeopardy with regard to an offense when a defendant has been convicted of that offense and has secured reversal of the conviction by appeal, here, Green was not convicted of first degree murder, and that offense was not involved in his appeal. If Green had only appealed his conviction of arson and that conviction had been set aside, surely no one would claim that he could have been tried a second time for the first degree murder by reasoning that his initial jeopardy on that charge continued until every offense alleged in the indictment had been finally adjudicated. Reduced to plain terms, the Government contends that, in order to secure the reversal of an erroneous conviction of one offense, a defendant must surrender his valid defence of former jeopardy not only on that offense, but also on a different offense for which he was not convicted and which was not involved in his appeal. Or, stated in the terms of this case, he must be willing to barter his constitutional protection against a second prosecution for an offense punishable by death as the price of a successful appeal from an erroneous conviction of another offense for which he has been sentenced to five to twenty years' imprisonment. As the Court of Appeal said in its first opinion in this case, a defendant faced with such a 'choice' takes a 'desperate chance' in securing the reversal of the erroneous conviction. The law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma. Mr Gould had no finding against him before the Board on Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A, and should not, according to his submission, be put in jeopardy on those charges in his application for review to the Tribunal. ASIC submits that there was no oppressive conduct or unfair dealing by it in relation to Contentions 2.1, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7A. ASIC relies on a point made by the Tribunal in rejecting Mr Gould's interlocutory application, namely, that situation before the Tribunal was materially different from that which had been before the Board. Before the Board, the application to amend was made at the end of a proceeding. Before the Tribunal, ASIC was giving notice through its SOFAC of allegations at the outset of a new proceeding. The United States case of Green v United States is distinguishable. The primary objective of the sanctions for which s 1292(2) provided was to protect the public where a person was shown not to be a fit and proper person to remain registered as a liquidator and as such to perform the duties of a liquidator or administrator. The criminal sanction for first degree murder is quite different in that the right of the accused to be treated fairly assumes the greatest importance. In the case of the disciplinary proceedings against Mr Gould, the protection of public was the dominant consideration. This factor also tells against other submissions made by Mr Gould, such as his submission asserting delay and oppression. Question 24 (set out at [260] above) should be answered ""no"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.071,0.145,0.783,-0.9952,-0.4121999999999999

Case679,National Education Advancement Programs (NEAP) Pty Ltd v Ashton (1995) 33 IPR 281,"National Education Advancement Programs (NEAP) Pty Ltd v Ashton (1995) 33 IPR 281 , Young J had to consider the question whether s 219 of the Law required an examination paper marketed by the plaintiff for use by schools for trial examinations to bear the plaintiff's ACN number. The answer turned on the question whether examination papers fell within s 88A of the Act. His Honour said (at p 293): An examination paper is not within the items specifically excluded from the definition in s 88A and one would have thought that such papers are closer to the categories of business letters etc than what is exempt, namely packaging. However, it does seem to me that the exercise in statutory interpretation is to look to see what is ejusdem generis with business letter, statement of account, invoice, receipt etc. All these documents are documents used in trade or commerce. An examination paper or a book or other writings which are intellectual property would seem to me to be in a different class. Young J said that while it was difficult to work out from ss 88A and 219 exactly where to draw the line, the test seemed to be whether the document concerned was one that was possibly part of a process of a business transaction or business contract involving the company. He said that if the document was non-contractual, the ACN number did not have to appear, because the purpose of s 219 appeared to be to make it clear that when a person was dealing with a company, exactly which company in perhaps a group of similarly named companies or companies using similar trading names, was the one with which the person was dealing. In my opinion, the purpose of s 450E(2) is generally similar: to make it clear to persons who are having or are contemplating having business dealings with the company or extending credit to it, that they are or will be dealing with a company that is subject to a DOCA. All five letters concerned were addressed to creditors of the particular company, Sisterella or Trinbay, that was subject to a DOCA. McPherson's Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, 2000, by Andrew Keay) states as follows in relation to the lien of a liquidator (at p 305): Liquidators normally have an equitable lien over the funds and assets in her or his control, not only for the costs and expenses of obtaining the property or funds but also for general remuneration [ Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Samalot Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1986) 5 NSWLR 227 ; 10 ACLR 748 , Shirlaw v Taylor (1991) 9 ACLC 1235]. While this has been accepted as the general position, Young J stated in Re Biposo Pty Ltd (No 4) [Unreported, Supreme Court, NSW, 12 December 1995] that it is an over-simplification to say that there was a lien over all of the moneys which liquidators have in their possession. His Honour went on to say that that is the normal situation, but the lien only arose if a court of equity felt that it was conscionable that there be a lien. I paraphrased the Tribunal's reasons in relation to Mr Gould's lien submission at [187] [188] above. That submission was raised for the first time in six lines in Mr Gould's written submissions before the Tribunal (para 161). While the Tribunal did not deal with the submission at length, it made it clear that the reason why the lien submission was not accepted was that the late fees were not a proper expense of the liquidation. I agree that they were not and that any lien that Mr Gould had did not extend to cover the $120. Moreover, when Mr Gould paid the $120 out of Popwing's liquidation account on 5 February 1999, he was not appropriating to himself money in part payment of fees then due to him. That he was not doing so is shown by the fact that neither in his later invoice nor elsewhere did he give credit for the sum of $120 as a payment of his fees. Nor was he preserving the fund as security for whatever fees might ultimately prove to be payable to him. At that time he was simply using money that he held for company purposes to pay $120 that he was personally liable to pay. His doing so cannot be justified retrospectively by a reconstruction of events or by an argument based on some concept of economic equivalence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.051,0.029,0.92,0.94,6.268000000000001

This approach was said to be consistent with s 43(1) of the AAT Act. It supports the view that the Tribunal's role and the Tribunal proceeding were independent of the Board's role and the Board proceeding. Once this fact is fully appreciated, any force that Mr Gould's present submission might be thought to have disappears. In my view there is no substance in Mr Gould's second submission either.

A person in Mr Shi's position could be found by the Tribunal to be unfit based on new facts that emerged after the original decision was made.

See also Apache Northwest Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd [2009] FCAFC 39 in relation to the principles applicable under O 15A r 6. Two of the considerations referred to in Hooper are critical to the determination of the present application. The first is that, although an applicant is not required to demonstrate the existence of a prima facie case against the prospective respondent, the power conferred by O 15A r 3 is not to be exercised in favour of a person who intends to commence ""merely speculative proceedings"". The prospects of success are a material factor in the exercise of the discretion: Hooper at [33]. The second consideration is that an applicant must show that the order is necessary in the interests of justice. Their Honours said that this means that an applicant must show that the making of the order is necessary to provide that person with an effective remedy in respect of the actionable wrong of which he or she complains: Hooper at [34]. The jurisdictional facts There was substantial argument between the parties as to whether two of the necessary jurisdictional facts were established. The first was whether Wyeth had made reasonable inquiries. The second was whether the ""proceeding"" to which O 15A r 3 refers is final or interlocutory, it being contended by the Department that Wyeth's purpose is to commence a proceeding for interlocutory relief, which is not contemplated by the Rule. These issues can be disposed of quite briefly. There was some force in Mr Howe's submission that Wyeth has not adduced any evidence of inquiries made overseas as to the identities of the sponsors. Wyeth acknowledged that TGA applications are often preceded by similar applications made in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that inquiries in those jurisdictions would not be conclusive. The test stated in Hooper does not expressly stipulate any threshold which an applicant must satisfy for the exercise of the power. But in stating that a material factor in the exercise of the discretion is the prospect of success in the proceedings, the Full Court in Hooper specified, as one of the elements of the claim for identity discovery, that an applicant provide evidence in support of its claim for final relief. In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper . Whilst good cause must be shown, each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice.

Case690,Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498,"observations of Jessup J in Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2008] FCA 1498 at [71] [73] recognise the difficulties which may arise in restoring a patentee to the position it occupies as the only supplier of the product in the event that the patent holder succeeds at the final hearing but is denied interlocutory relief. Nevertheless, I have come to the view that it is not in the interests of justice to order identity discovery on this application. There are two reasons for this. First, I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Wyeth has good prospects of success at a final hearing. The most that can be said is that it has a provisional working hypothesis which would need to be supplemented by further evidence, including expert evidence, to determine the strength of Wyeth's case.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.17,0.063,0.766,0.9633,6.26155
Case691,Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695,"counsel for the Department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of French J in Viskase Corporation v Cryovac Inc [2000] FCA 1695. There, his Honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under O 15A r 6. He said at [24] that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions. He continued:- In respect of patents for inventions, the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors. To allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for pre-action discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here. However, these remarks are to be read in their context. His Honour expressed the view at [23] that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of O 15A r 6, namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent, was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule. His Honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of O 15A r 6(a). I do not think it follows that his Honour's observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under O 15A r 3. It is true that French J said at [24] that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule. But, in my opinion, that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the ""reasonable cause to believe"". In my view the decision in Viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in Hooper .

His Honour proceeded on the basis that the ground is available if the use of the mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion for any reason. 178 In Norco , Bryson J was of the view that there was no likelihood of deception because the packaging of the goods accurately identified the source of the goods and the registered owner of the trade mark: Norco at [84]. 179 In the present case, Health World points to the evidence which discloses that at the date of the commencement of the rectification proceedings, the Health Plus trade mark was used to identify the goods as those of Nature's Hive, and not those of Shin-Sun. I will deal with this below. 180 This would give rise to the likelihood of deception or cause confusion because of the failure to identify the registered owner as the source of the goods. 182 Pending consideration of s 88(2)(c) by a Full Court, or by the High Court, it seems to me that I should follow the approach adopted by Bryson J in Norco . On that basis the s 88(2)(c) ground is enlivened by the failure to distinguish the Health Plus products as goods of Shin-Sun. 183 In dealing, later in my judgment, with Health World's non-use application, I give six reasons why the Health Plus trade mark is used to identify the goods as those of Nature's Hive. 184 In summary, the effect of the evidence was that Shin-Sun's name has never appeared on the packaging and Nature's Hive procured the manufacture of the products.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.012,0.083,0.906,-0.9633,-0.2975500000000002

Case696,CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42,"Those authorities, as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42 and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365, were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's at [80] [90]. 196 There was nothing to suggest that Shin-Sun exercised quality control in the way in which the executors of the estate of Cyril Henschke exercised control over the Henschke partnership: Henschke at [67]. 197 Nor did Shin-Sun exercise ""financial control"" over Nature's Hive's trading activities within the meaning of s 8(4). This is because, in my view, the financial control to which the subsection is directed is a legally enforceable power of control which did not exist between Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive. 198 Ms Shin's evidence was that Nature's Hive did not have a bank account. I accept this evidence but it does not follow that Shin-Sun exercised financial control within the meaning of s 8(4). What that subsection requires is evidence of the exercise of financial control over trading activities, perhaps in the way in which a parent company may exercise control over a wholly owned subsidiary. Here, there was no such relationship and any control by Shin-Sun was revocable: Henschke at [69]. 199 Nature's Hive and Shin-Sun have different shareholders. They have common directors but that has only been the position since July 2006. Of course, in a practical sense, it may be unlikely that Ms Shin would remove her parents as directors of Nature's Hive. But that is not an answer to the separate corporate identity of Shin-Sun and the power of Ms Shin as the majority shareholder to revoke any exercise of control flowing from common directorships. 200 The ""control"" which is contemplated by s 8(5) would seem to be as wide as the ""connection in the course of trade"" to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at 683. His Honour said that the connection may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary: see also Henschke at [70]. 223 Section 101(3) confers a broad discretion on the Court: Henschke at [72]. The discretion is conferred so as to give the Court a sufficient degree of flexibility to give effect to public interest considerations: Ritz Hotel at 221-225. 224 In Henschke , the Full Court declined to interfere with the primary judge's exercise of discretion in a manner favourable to the registered proprietor under s 101(3). However, I do not consider that the approach taken in that case assists Shin-Sun because the primary judge found that there was no public interest adversely affected by the use of the mark: see at [72]. 225 In my view, Henschke was concerned with a very distinctive family business where the members of the family who were using the mark were the persons who gave the mark its value. That was why the primary judge could see no useful purpose to be served by removing the mark so as to compel a fresh application to be made by the ""Henschke interests."" 226 Accordingly, I would not exercise my discretion in favour of Shin-Sun in the present proceedings. 227 Section 92 in the form in which it stood when Health World filed its non-use application provided that a person aggrieved had standing to bring an application.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.048,0.034,0.917,0.8878,6.090300000000001

However, the general rule of the common law, and the effect of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act , is that: when the law is altered during the pendency of an action the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights: see Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein &amp; Bro Inc [1960] HCA 37 ; (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427 per Kitto J. 31 All three of the proceedings described were commenced prior to the commencement of the Trade Marks Amendment Act 2006 (Cth) on 23 October 2006. The rectification proceeding was commenced on 13 February 2006. Health World's non-use application was commenced on 25 July 2006. Shin-Sun's non-use application was commenced on 15 September 2006. Thus in the absence of a clear legislative intention to the contrary, the provisions of the Act apply as they stood prior to the 2006 amendments. The relevant provisions are set out below, in their pre-amendment form. 32 Section 7 of the Act deals with the use of a trade mark. It provides: 7 Use of trade mark (1) If the Registrar or a prescribed court, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, thinks fit, the Registrar or the court may decide that a person has used a trade mark if it is established that the person has used the trade mark with additions or alterations that do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark. (2) To avoid any doubt, it is stated that, if a trade mark consists of the following, or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name or numeral, any aural representation of the trade mark is, for the purposes of this Act, a use of the trade mark. (3) An authorised use of a trade mark by a person (see section 8) is taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be a use of the trade mark by the owner of the trade mark. (4) In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods) ... 118 The expression ""an aggrieved person"" is to be given a wide interpretation: see In the Matter of Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 RPC 195 at 201 (C.A.

Case699,Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Limited v Mobileworld Communications Pty Limited (2004) 61 IPR 212,"Section 10 of the Act defines the expression ""deceptively similar"". The opposed mark must so nearly resemble the other mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion. The authorities dealing with the question of whether one trade mark is deceptively similar to another were reviewed by a Full Court of this Court in Crazy Ron's Communications Pty Limited v Mobileworld Communications Pty Limited (2004) 61 IPR 212 at [72]ff. 130 The Full Court in Crazy Ron's distilled five legal principles from the many authorities which have dealt with this subject. Their Honours were dealing with the question of deceptive similarity in the context of trade mark infringement but the same principles apply to the test of deceptive similarity in s 60 as it stood in May 2001. 131 It is unnecessary to set out the five principles stated in Crazy Ron's . It is sufficient to say that the marks are not to be judged by a side by side comparison; they are to be considered by their look and sound, with due allowance for imperfect recollection. The goods to which the marks are to be applied must be considered together with all the surrounding circumstances. 146 Those authorities, as well as authorities of Full Courts in CA Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Limited (2000) 52 IPR 42 and Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Limited [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365, were discussed by the Full Court in Crazy Ron's at [80] [90]. 147 The effect of those authorities is that the enquiry is not as wide as would be undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act . Rather, the search is to be concentrated on ascertaining the essential element of the mark and the impression taken away by one who looks at it and how it sounds when pronounced: Crazy Ron's at [86], [88]. 148 The essential element of the Inner Health Plus mark is not found in the words ""Health Plus"". Rather, as I have already said, the idea or essential feature of Inner Health Plus is that it is concerned with internal health. Health Plus embraces a different concept. 149 To the extent that any notoriety of Inner Health Plus is to be taken into account, consumers must be taken to be familiar with it as an improved and more convenient version of Inner Health powder: Crazy Ron's at [90]. 151 Furthermore, there is no tangible danger of deception or confusion: Crazy Ron's at [76]. The Inner Health Plus product and the goods encompassed by the Health Plus trade mark have their own separate attributes. They may be recommended by health professionals. Their purchase is likely to be a considered decision after close appraisal and consideration.

On that date, s 88(2)(a) enlivened the power to order rectification of the register on ""any of the grounds on which registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under Division 2 of Part 5"". The pre-amendment form of s 88(2)(a) still requires s 60 to be applied as it stood when the trade mark was filed on 7 May 2001. The significance of applying the pre-amendment form rather than current form of s 88(2)(a) is that Health World is precluded from relying on the 'contrary to law' ground under s 42 (that provision not being found in Division 2 of Part 5). 116 For all these reasons, it follows, in my opinion, that the ground of opposition based upon deceptive similarity is to be determined under s 60 in its pre-amended form.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.021,0.015,0.964,0.3027,4.05345
Case703,Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 64 IPR 495,In December 2001 Health World filed notice of opposition to the Health Plus trade mark relying inter alia on the ground contained in s 60. The Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the opposition but Health World appealed to the Federal Court under s 56 of the Act. The appeal was heard by Cooper J. His Honour determined the appeal adversely to Health World: see Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2005) 64 IPR 495.,Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.096,0.054,0.85,0.6808,5.3408
Case704,Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647 ,"The present proceedings are, of course, not an appeal from Cooper J. Nor is Health World estopped from asserting that the Health Plus mark was deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus trade mark at 7 May 2001, even though Cooper J found on the balance of probabilities that the Health Plus mark was not deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark as at that date: see Health World v Shin-Sun (per Cooper J) at [6], [41]; Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 647. 11 The proceedings before me consist of three separate applications. In the first, Health World seeks expungement of the Health Plus mark under ss 88(2)(a) and (c) of the Act. This proceeding is sometimes referred to as the rectification proceeding. 12 Section 88(2)(a) provides that an application for cancellation or removal of a mark may be made on any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under the Act. The grounds on which Health World relies in the rectification proceeding are those contained in ss 42 , 59 and 60 . 96 Indeed, the entire thrust of Health World's launch of the Inner Health Plus capsules was to take advantage of the reputation of the Inner Health Powder and the goodwill attaching to it. This is graphically revealed in Mr Joiner's evidence in the proceedings before Cooper J, as put to Mr Joiner by counsel for Shin Sun in cross-examination in the present proceedings. The relevant passage is as follows: I did not want to discontinue the Inner Health line as it had been and was still a successful product. I believed that the fact that Inner Health was an established product in its field gave Health World an excellent opportunity to introduce a new type of probiotic product similar to the existing Inner Health product but in an improved version which could be launched onto the market. My plan was to take advantage of the goodwill which had already been built up in the Inner Health brand. 97 I understood Mr Joiner to accept the accuracy of this evidence when it was put to him in cross-examination before me. In any event, its accuracy is fully supported by the promotional and advertising material referred to above. 98 It is true that when Inner Health Plus capsules were introduced they contained bifidobacteria which were not an ingredient of Inner Health powder at that time. But that does not distinguish the reputation of Inner Health Plus from its predecessor. 110 Second, this approach to construction is consistent with the scheme of the Act as discussed by a Full Court in Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2003] AIPC 91-839 at [18].

The principal factors would therefore seem to be the public interest and the respective contributions made by the parties to the proceedings in creating the likelihood that the use of the registered mark would deceive or cause confusion: New South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Limited [1990] HCA 60 ; (1990) 171 CLR 363 at 391 per Brennan J. 208 In my view, these factors point against the exercise of the discretion so that even if I may withhold relief under s 88(1), I would not exercise my discretion to do so. In short, it seems to me that the public interest is better served by expunging a mark that has become deceptive in the circumstances of this case. 209 Even though I am satisfied that Health World has made out the grounds for rectification under s 88(2)(a) (the s 59 ground) and s 88(2)(c), in my view it does not have standing to seek the relief because it is not an aggrieved person. 210 As I said above, I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the Health Plus mark. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that it has a real interest in having the Health Plus mark removed. Nor would it be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the mark remains on the register. 211 By reason of my findings on the questions of the reputation of Inner Health Plus and deceptive similarity, I reject the claims of contravention of the Trade Practices Act and passing off against both Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.102,0.045,0.853,0.9536,6.280600000000001

Case712,Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 ,"In Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670 at 686, Aickin J recognised that a mark may be used to indicate a connection with an unidentified person. His Honour said that in those circumstances it must indicate a connection with both the proprietor and the user. 188 In my opinion, that requirement is not satisfied as a matter of fact because the evidence does not demonstrate any connection between the actual use of the mark and the registered proprietor, Shin-Sun. 189 Nevertheless, Shin-Sun contends that s 88(2)(c) is not enlivened because Nature's Hive's use of the mark was under the control of Shin-Sun so that Nature's Hive was an ""authorised user"" within the meaning of s 8(1) of the Act. 191 However, s 8(3) and s 8(4) do not limit the meaning of the expression ""under the control of"" the owner of the trade mark in s 8(1): see s 8(5). It is therefore necessary to deal with the question of whether Shin-Sun exercised quality or financial control over Nature's Hive's use of the mark, or whether it controlled the use in the broad sense referred to by Aickin J in Pioneer at 683. 192 There is no evidence before me that Shin-Sun has exercised quality control over the Health Plus products manufactured for Nature's Hive and supplied under Nature's Hive's packaging. 193 Indeed, in my view, the evidence establishes that Nature's Hive has the relevant obligations of quality control under the Therapeutic Goods Act . Nature's Hive is the sponsor and the certificate of listing for the goods imposes the obligation of quality control on Nature's Hive. 200 The ""control"" which is contemplated by s 8(5) would seem to be as wide as the ""connection in the course of trade"" to which Aickin J referred in Pioneer at 683. His Honour said that the connection may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary: see also Henschke at [70]. 201 However, Aickin J observed in Pioneer at 683 that it is essential that the user maintains the connection of the registered proprietor with the goods. That connection is not established on the facts of the present case. 202 It follows in my view that Nature's Hive was not an authorised user of the mark. It also follows that the use of the Health Plus trade mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of s 88(2)(c) of the Act.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.019,0.025,0.956,-0.0854,2.7070999999999996

It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider that test. 153 Under the amended form of the section it would be necessary to consider that question because a finding of deceptive similarity is no longer a pre-requisite. However, even if the amended form of the section applies, Health World would not succeed in its application for rectification on this ground. 154 Section 60(a) as amended would be enlivened because Inner Health Plus had acquired the necessary reputation. But the causal link required under s 60(b) would not be made out.

This does not satisfy the test stated in the authorities to which McLelland J referred in the Ritz Hotel case at 202-203. 170 Ms Shin, in her affidavit of 20 December 2006, stated that Shin-Sun conceived the Health Plus mark and that she had taken certain steps on behalf of that company which were consistent with an intention, as at 7 May 2001, for Shin-Sun to use the mark. 171 However, the overall effect of her evidence was that she failed to distinguish between the two separate corporate entities, Shin-Sun and Nature's Hive. I cannot be satisfied, and I find that she did not pay attention to which corporation she was representing when she took the steps that she relies upon to support the assertion that Shin-Sun intended to use the mark. 223 Section 101(3) confers a broad discretion on the Court: Henschke at [72].

Case721,Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36,"On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 ("" Wu ""). 6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents. I found (at [52]-[53]) that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules. My reasons for judgment record that: &#8226; The applicant (hereafter referred to as Ms Wu) was required to bring an application to the Court for an order for substituted service as regards Mr Armitage ([7]-[8]). &#8226; Ms Wu applied twice by motion for orders that the respondents, including Mr Armitage, provide their lists of documents and the respondents, including Mr Armitage, breached orders of 8 October 2003 and 16 December 2003 for the provision of these lists ([10]-[13]). From September 2003 until 14 April 2004, Mr Armitage and the other respondents retained a solicitor (Mr Joseph Guss) ([8] and [15]). &#8226; Mr Armitage failed to make documents available for inspection, despite orders by the Court on 8 October 2003, 16 December 2003 and 9 June 2004 ([10]-[17]). Following an order for further discovery on 4 March 2004, Mr Armitage filed an affidavit stating that the first respondent's accounts and statutory records were ""mistakenly removed by a waste paper removalist with various other papers and records"" and that he was unable to locate his file in respect of Ms Wu's application for an Australian visa and her alleged investment in the first respondent ([14]). &#8226; After 14 April 2004, Ms Wu's solicitor's attempted to contact the respondents, including Mr Armitage directly. By a letter dated 21 April 2004, Mr Armitage informed Ms Wu's solicitors that he was ""unable to facilitate"" the inspection of the discovered documents because they were ""located at the office of Joseph Guss"" ([15]). &#8226; On the first occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that she was instructed by solicitors who expected to act in the matter. This expectation was not fulfilled ([17]). &#8226; On the second occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, different counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that he was instructed by solicitors, who subsequently advised the Court that they were no longer retained to act for Mr Armitage (or any other respondent) in the proceeding ([19]). &#8226; Although it was made clear in court on 13 October 2004 that it was open to the respondents to serve a subpoena on their previous solicitor (Mr Guss) to produce the discovered documents to the Court the respondents did not take steps to do this until 3 December 2004 ([19] and [21]). &#8226; On 3 December 2004, George Liberogiannis and Associates went on record as solicitor for the Armitages, including Barry Armitage. Mr Liberogiannis did not, however, appear on the return of the subpoena. The subpoena was not discharged against Mr Guss until 16 February 2005 ([21]-[22]). &#8226; At the adjourned hearing of the motion for default judgment on 27 April 2005, Mr Liberogiannis sought leave to withdraw as the solicitor on the record. His evidence was that Barry Armitage and his son had failed to keep appointments with counsel and to provide him with instructions for the conduct of the matter, notwithstanding his numerous calls to their cell phones and place of residence. His firm filed a notice of ceasing to act for Barry Armitage and his son on 28 April 2005 ([24]). 7 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons stated in Wu at [54] and following, I declined to make orders in terms of the motion for default judgment. At [54]-[55], I said: ""I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part. If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents. Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody. Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J. Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation. I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays. These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation. Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents. They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor. Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents."" 10 Mr Armitage's earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri are mentioned in Wu at [27] and [31]. Mr Armitage's lengthy affidavit of 16 May 2006 deposes to matters of fact. It also contains what are in truth submissions on his motion. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Mr Armitage claimed (amongst other things): &#8226; Mr Armitage was unable to collect his documents relating to this matter from previously retained counsel (Mr Dennis Baker) until 4 May 2006. He had not previously seen some of these documents. &#8226; Prior to the hearing on 27 April 2005, Mr Armitage had no knowledge of the affidavit of Anna Maria Krycer of 12 April 2005; that Mr Lieberogiannis intended to seek leave to withdraw from the proceeding; and that he would be unrepresented at that hearing. He claimed that he was denied an opportunity to respond to Ms Krycer's affidavit and Mr Lieberogiannis' evidence. &#8226; After receiving a copy of the 27 April 2005 order (granting leave to Mr Lieberogiannis to cease to act) Mr Armitage asked Registry ""what was happening with the proceedings"" and was told that ""no other date had been appointed, and that it appeared that there was no further action or procedure contemplated"". He returned to the Registry on two further occasions. He assumed the action was not proceeding. &#8226; When the respondents retained Mr Guss, they gave Mr Guss all relevant documents and did not retain any copies. In early April 2004, there was a dispute between Mr Guss and Mr Armitage (and other respondents), as a consequence of which Mr Guss ceased to act for them. Mr Guss claimed a lien over the respondents' documents. Mr Armitage photocopied the documents on the Court file. &#8226; After Mr Guss ceased to act, the respondents decided to draft instructions, affidavits and other documents needed in the proceeding and to engage counsel ""to finalise documents and make any necessary Court appearances"". Ultimately, a barrister's clerk ""agreed to arrange for solicitors (not then known to the Respondents) to provide the 'Back Sheets' required to brief counsel"". Mr Armitage added: ""In practice, the arrangement ... did not provide a proper level of legal services and ... Mr Baker agreed to provide a 'budget-type' representation for the Respondents."" &#8226; Mr Liberogiannis agreed to act as solicitor on the record, ""with the Respondents providing all secretarial-type support, full written instructions, and the like"". Mr Baker agreed to supervise the work and retain the documents relevant to the proceeding. Mr Baker therefore held all relevant documents and the respondents retained no copies. &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son (the third respondent) attended Mr Baker's chambers frequently, ""often on two occasions a week"". Mr Armitage deposed: ""In the period leading up to 27 April 2005 I was aware that the matter was to come back before the Court fairly soon, but I was not aware of the nature of the anticipated proceedings."" &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son were unable to keep an arrangement to meet Mr Baker on 22 April 2005 and left a message that they would attend on 26 April 2005. They did not attend Mr Baker's chambers on 26 April 2005 because their car ""broke down in the countryside"" and they did not contact Mr Baker because ""we were in an area of poor mobile telephone reception"". &#8226; Mr Armitage did not find out about the 27 April hearing until after the scheduled time of the hearing. He added that ""[w]e immediately tried to contact Mr Baker and he told us we should speak to Mr Liberogiannis"". &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son made unsuccessful attempts to contact Mr Liberogiannis, whom he ultimately met ""by chance"" early this year. &#8226; Hereafter, the respondents intended to act on their own behalf and ""to retain full control and ensure that all matters requiring attention are dealt with promptly"". &#8226; Mr Armitage had severe health problems and associated difficulties, including inability to give ""sustained personal attention to ... this litigation"". &#8226; Mr Armitage resigned as director of the first respondent because it could be insolvent. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not intentionally avoid service of the documents initiating this proceeding. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not attend court because of his health, the fact he had legal representation, and because Ms Wu, through her solicitors, had threatened him. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware of Ms Wu's desire to inspect the discovered documents until he received a letter dated 20 April 2004 from her solicitors. He responded the next day. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware until late November or early December 2004 that the Court had indicated that it would give leave to issue a subpoena to Mr Guss to obtain the documents for Ms Wu's inspection. He claimed that Mr Guss still held relevant documents. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not know that Mr Liberogiannis had failed to attend on the return of the subpoena. He did not knowingly breach any order of the Court. He ""should not be held responsible for ... delays ... during the time"" when Mr Guss and Mr Liberogiannis acted for him. 11 In addition, Mr Armitage challenged the reliability of the evidence of Ms Xia but it is unnecessary to provide the details of that challenge here. He also expanded on his claim that the initiating application and statement of claim in the proceeding were ""based on a serious fraud and constitutes an abuse of the processes of this ... Court"". He asserted that Ms Wu had made fraudulent claims in relation to her migration objective and investment claims. He responded to Ms Wu's claims against him at some length and alleged that her former and present solicitors had acted improperly in various ways. It is unnecessary to set out the details of these various allegations here. 12 In his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage further contended that the costs order of 3 February 2006 was unjust. This was because the primary matter in dispute had been the production of documents, over which he had no control. Also, so he said, Ms Wu's claims were fraudulent and, if he were required to meet the costs order before the determination of the proceeding, he would be prevented from defending himself. Mr Armitage specifically noted that paragraphs 36 and 38 of the statement of claim alleged that he acted dishonesty.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.029,0.054,0.917,-0.9962,-0.46169999999999956
Case722,Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66,"Notwithstanding this, for the reasons stated in Wu at [54] and following, I declined to make orders in terms of the motion for default judgment. At [54]-[55], I said: ""I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part. If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents. Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody. Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J. Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation. I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays. These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation. Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents. They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor. Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.03,0.042,0.928,-0.6486,0.7419000000000007

In this regard, he pointed out that Mr Armitage was heard, through his counsel, on the motion on two occasions and the affidavit material on which he relied was before the Court. The fact that his solicitor ""went off the record"" on 27 April 2005 ""did not make any difference to the Orders"".

Case728,"KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") [1995] FCA 354","Mr Armitage stated on oath that the respondents made the arrangements that led to the retainer of legal representatives, who knew little or nothing of their case and took little or no responsibility for its ongoing conduct. This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes. Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives. They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute. Nor can they excuse themselves by relying on a series of ""unfortunate events"", as Mr Armitage sought to do. If it were otherwise, case management would prove virtually impossible: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 ("" KM &amp; A Chadwick "") at [15] per Tamberlin J. 35 Ms Wu has, moreover, proceeded to the taxation contemplated by the orders in question, as indeed she was entitled to do. In so doing she has incurred further costs. In this regard, I note, however, that Mr Armitage has been most assiduous in contesting the taxation. His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings. 36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick . 37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence. Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result. That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable. It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence. 38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders. For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion. As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.089,0.064,0.847,0.9237,6.207949999999999

Case739,Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited [2006] FCA 1441,"This proceeding commenced by application dated 8 March 2006. A statement of claim was filed on the same day. Both the application and the statement of claim were subsequently amended. On 6 November 2006 I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck out but granted leave to replead on or before 30 November 2006: see [2006] FCA 1441. I expressed some scepticism as to whether a case under the former s 298K of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (""the Act "") could be pleaded conformably with the reasons which I gave for striking out the pleading: see [2006] FCA 1441 at [34] . Not deterred the applicant filed a further amended application and a second further amended statement of claim on 30 November 2006. By notice of motion dated 18 December 2006, which was filed on 17 January 2007, the respondent seeks an order striking out the proceeding, or alternatively, the second further amended statement of claim. 2 The amended application sought the imposition of penalties on the respondent and orders for compensation, injunctions and declarations with respect to alleged contraventions of s 298K of the Act . 3 The further amended statement of claim was struck out because it did not plead facts sufficient to establish any contravention of s 298K before that provision was repealed on 27 March 2006. Specifically, it was held that the facts pleaded did not establish that when, in December 2005 and February 2006, the respondent announced a decision to transfer four Airbuses to Jetstar late in 2006 and early in 2007 and that those aircraft would not be crewed by its employees, it had thereby injured or prejudicially changed the position of particular employees or threatened to do either or both of these things. 8 The relevant legislation is set out in my earlier reasons: see [2006] FCA 1441 at [4] to [7]. 9 The respondent raises many complaints about the amended pleading. They may be summarised as follows: &#8226; No new material facts are pleaded which could support the allegation that the respondent had contravened s 298K(1)(b) and/or (c) on or before 27 March 2006. &#8226; Some conduct by the respondent which is said to be directed to the implementation of the December 2005 decision such as the transfer of the aircraft and the loss of remuneration and leave entitlements occurred after 27 March 2006 and yet is relied on to support alleged contraventions of s 298K. &#8226; The amended pleading is incomprehensible and embarrassing. This is because, in para 31B, the applicant contends that the making and communication of the 2005 decision (which occurred before 27 March 2006) and the steps taken to implement it (which occurred after 27 March 2006) constituted the relevant injury and/or alteration to prejudice. A reason (the pre 27 March 2006 requirement) for the respondent's impugned conduct is said to be that the pilots were entitled to the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement (para 32). Although para 32 covers conduct occurring both before and after 27 March 2006, para 32A pleads that ""in the premises"" the respondent has contravened s 298K. Paragraph 32B then pleads, in the alternative, that the sole or dominant reason (the post 27 March 2006 requirement) for the respondent's impugned conduct was that the pilots had the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement. Paragraph 32C pleads that ""in the premises"" the respondent has, since 27 March 2006, contravened s 792(1) of the amended Act . The respondent complains that, by pleading its case in this way, the applicant has merged the separate causes of action provided for in ss 298K and 792 thereby creating confusion such that the respondent is unable to comprehend the case it is called upon to meet or plead to it. 10 The applicant sought to meet these objections by pointing to the amendment to para 31B which now includes a reference to the ""implementation"" of the decision. Most of the steps which it is said were taken as part of the implementation process were alleged to have occurred prior to 27 March 2006. The steps relied on by counsel for the applicant which occurred at this time were: &#8226; The respondent's decision that Jetstar would upgrade its air operator certificate so it could operate wide bodied long haul aircraft: para 19. &#8226; The negotiations in December 2005 and 2006 with the Jetstar pilots' counsel to introduce terms and conditions of employment which would apply to Jetstar pilots involved in long haul flying: para 21. &#8226; The respondent's refusal to permit the applicant to participate in those negotiations: para 20. &#8226; The respondent's refusal, on or about 10 February 2006, to entertain negotiations with the applicant for alternative terms and conditions of employment upon which the Airbus fleet pilots would carry out the work on the four aircraft allocated to Jetstar: para 25A. &#8226; The variation, on or about 10 March 2006, of the Jetstar agreement as a consequence of agreement reached in negotiations: paras 23 and 24. The steps taken after 27 March 2006 which are relied on were the transfer of the three aircraft in October and November 2006: paras 25I, 25J and 25K.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.053,0.05,0.897,0.743,5.5975
Case740,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Under the error of law ground it is said that the Minister made findings of fact not supported by evidence. These are set out in Annexure 1. It should be noted that there is no ground under s 5 of the ADJR Act which explicitly authorises judicial review on the basis of findings of fact ""not supported by the evidence"". That ground appears to be wider than the ""no evidence"" ground in s 5(1)(h). In this case, however, the relevant particular appears to be relied upon to support a finding that the Minister erred in law. In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321, Mason CJ discussed the relationship between error of law contemplated by s 5(1)(f) of the ADJR Act and the ""no evidence"" ground referred to in s 5(1)(h) as elucidated in s 5(3). He said (at 358): The better view, one which seeks to harmonize the two grounds of review, is to treat ""error of law"" in s 5(1)(f) as embracing the ""no evidence"" ground as it was accepted and applied in Australia before the enactment of the AD(JR) Act and to treat the ""no evidence"" ground in s 5(1)(h), as elucidated in s 5(3), as expanding that ground of review in the applications for which pars (a) and (b) of s 5(3) make provision. Within the area of operation of par (a) it is enough to show an absence of evidence or material from which the decision-maker could reasonably be satisfied that the particular matter was established, that being a lesser burden than that of showing an absence of evidence (or material) to support the decision. The lengthy list of findings set out in Annexure 1 to the statement of claim gives rise to concern that this judicial review process may slide into merits review if not confined to its proper area. It is, however, too early in the proceedings to make any definitive observation in that regard. 10 It is, as counsel for the applicant suggests, open to the Court to give directions that the matter proceed on pleadings. I am not however convinced that this is a necessary course. The judicial review challenge is based upon the Minister's findings. Much of the statement of claim would not appear to be contentious as to background facts. It asserts legal duties and errors but a defence would not sharpen the issues in that respect. The question whether there was or was not evidence to support the findings referred to in Annexure 1 is not a question the resolution of which will be assisted by the filing of a defence. I am prepared to let the applicant's statement of claim stand as a statement of its case. Otherwise, in my opinion, the matter should proceed by way of affidavit and written submissions which may include the provision by the respondent of schedules identifying, in answer to Annexure 1, the evidence said to be supportive of the findings of fact there mentioned and in respect of Annexure 2, the material, if any, relied upon to show that the relevant matters there listed were, if mandatory relevant considerations, taken into account. 11 On the matter of discovery, having regard to the materials which have been disclosed, namely those set out in the Minister's reasons for decision, I see no utility in making any order for general discovery. Phosphate, however, submits that the Minister ought to discover: 1. Documentary material relevant to show what he did and read as his """"consideration"" in a real sense and undertaking an active intellectual process"" of the material in the documents listed in [28] of the reasons. 2. Documentary material evidencing the time spent reading the documents. 3.

Case741,NATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 112 ,"extracting the text of s 424A(1) of the Act, Smith FM thereafter referred to NATL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 112 at [14] , where a Full Federal Court (Ryan, Finkelstein and Downes JJ) pointed out that the reference in s 424A to 'particulars of any information... does not require the provision of evidence' , and further that '[t] he test is whether an applicant is fairly informed of the information considered to be adverse' . Upon that basis, his Honour observed, ' [i] n some cases, the objects of the section might only be able to be met by the actual provision of a copy of the source documents for the Tribunal's information. For example, where the Tribunal proposes to draw information from the appearance of a document which can not adequately be described in particulars.' His Honour then went on to observe that the '... s 424A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy, which was then used in its reasons...'. The ' gist ' of that information obtained by the Tribunal, as so described by his Honour, '... comprised details of a claimed employment, the fact that letters had been given to the Embassy in corroboration of that employment, and that Embassy staff ""had confirmed with the rector of the institute the claimed employment and position"" . His Honour concluded that the letter '... sufficiently identified the potential relevance of that information, being that it was inconsistent with the factual claims of the [appellant] to the Tribunal as to his employment in Armenia and that he was in hiding' , and that as further stated in that letter in conclusion, those 'inconsistencies have the potential to cast doubt on the credibility of your claims to have had problems with the Armenian authorities for political reasons' .

Case744,SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2004) 215 ALR 162,"should first be observed that the Tribunal, which was a respondent in the proceedings below, has not been named as a respondent in the notice of appeal. In the light of the High Court decision of SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; 215 ALR 162 at [43] , [91], [153] and [180], the Tribunal should be joined as a second respondent to the current proceedings. In the context of the present appeal, the appellant sought to tender his affidavit evidence of 17 July 2006; prior thereto, the appellant had failed to file any written submissions. The Minister indicated that there was no objection to the Court receiving the affidavit as constituting the appellant's submissions, but observed that if it were to be treated as evidence, it 'would be objected to'. The Minister went on to observe that the affidavit contained material that was not before the Court below or the Tribunal. I have received the affidavit to the extent that it may serve as submissions for the appellant. The principal features of the affidavit are as follows (using where appropriate the text of the affidavit): (i) his confirmation that his application for an Australian visa asserted that he 'was the Head of the Biology Department at Vanevan University'; (ii) his claim that 'the 16 th International Congress of Eye Research's Conference Co-ordinator wrote to [him] at the University on 5 August 2004'; (iii) 'the head of the Vanevan Institute wrote a letter on [his] behalf to the Australian Embassy in Moscow dated 11 August 2004 saying that [he] had been head of the [biology] department since 2000'; and (iv) '... the presiding member had been obliged to duly inform [him] of the information considered to be adverse'; The appellant made the further submission that '... the Tribunal's s 424A letter did not properly identify particulars of the information obtained from Moscow Embassy (as well as from other sources)', and that '[g]iven [the] importance of the issue I am of the view that the Tribunal was obliged to provide me not only with particulars of the information gained from Moscow but with the copies of letters mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Affidavit', and to do so for three reasons, which he formulated as follows: (i) '... the Tribunal made its own research. At 154 (CB) it was confirmed that the University does exist in Armenia. However the address of the University is entirely different'; (ii) '[a]ccording to one of the letters the presiding member relied on, the Vanevan University is located at 51/25 Pushkin Street, Yerevan 375002 Armenia' (a letter of 5 August 2004, marked annexure A, was attached to his affidavit); (iii) '[a]ccording to information obtained by the Tribunal, the said University is located in a different town (even in a different region) at 26 Miasnikyan Street, Town of Martuni, Gehgardunik Region, Armenia' (reference was thereupon made to what appears at page 154 of the Court Book).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.018,0.014,0.968,0.5106,4.7831
Case745,SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214,"appellant submitted that '[f]urthermore if to accept the Minister's suggestion that the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision because it was not satisfied that I had been a PPA member given my alleged lack of knowledge of PPA, or [because] it ""was not satisfied by the copy of my membership card"", or [because] the Tribunal ""was troubled by the fact"" that I did not tell about the documents submitted to the Embassy early in the hearing, then it must be accepted that the Tribunal was in breach of s 424A of the Migration Act [because] it did not give me the opportunity to comment on this information.' The contention such as it was, is misconceived and without juridical foundation. The Minister submitted that those contentions made by the appellant regarding page seventeen of the Tribunal's judgment constituted 'a new section 424A case which was not put to the Federal Magistrate', in that the appellant contended that that information was not the subject of the section 424A notice provided to the appellant. The Minister pointed out rightly that those matters referred to by the appellant were all evaluations of evidence, not information within the meaning of s 424A of the Act. Reference was made by the Minister in that regard to the dictum of Allsop J in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [206] - [207] , where his Honour discussed what is encompassed by the statutory notion of information in the context of s 424A(1) of the Act. Allsop J observed as follows: 'Information does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54], Paul at [95] and VAF at [24]. In this respect, it is relevant to recall the root of the word 'information': that of which one has been told or apprised, or informed. The distinction can become fine: Paul at [95]. It is a distinction, nevertheless, to be maintained. Also, the fact that appraisal, thought processes and determination are not information does not mean they are not relevant to the operation of s 424A. The thought processes of the Tribunal may reveal the relevance of information for s 424A(1)(b) and may assist in understanding what the Tribunal must say or do to comply with s 424A(1)(a) , (b) or (c).' In the light of the above authority, I am persuaded that Smith FM was correct to conclude in his decision below that the ' s 424A letter sufficiently identified particulars of the information gained from the Moscow Embassy, which was then used by the Tribunal in its reasons...'. The appellant concluded the case on appeal as follows: 'Moreover, even if to accept that in such circumstances the Tribunal was not in breach of s 424A of the Act, it is to be accepted that the Tribunal acted unfairly. And this unfairness is to be regarded as denial of procedural fairness and, itself the issue of apprehended bias.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.059,0.022,0.919,0.9474,6.2789

However, it may be observed that because s 422B of the Act took effect in relation to the present proceedings, the natural justice hearing rule has no application beyond the textual requirements contained within that section of the Act. The Minister referred in that regard to the Full Court decision of SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 (Heerey, Conti and Jacobson JJ), ' in which the decision of the same Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 was applied to find that section 422B excluded the common law natural justice hearing rule' .",Criminal Case,Rape,0.101,0.033,0.865,0.8576,5.9306

Case748,Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199,turn to the second proceeding and the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. It is a well accepted principle that it is not open to me to grant an interlocutory injunction in the air in the absence of a cause of action to be adjudicated upon at trial. It was made clear in Australian Broadcasting Commission v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 that an interlocutory injunction should only be granted by a court in support of a known cause of action upon which the applicant for the interlocutory injunction wishes to rely at trial. The applicants relied upon the following causes of action: (a) The proposal by the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases constitutes oppressive conduct and conduct not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole giving rise to causes of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. The 40 year sub-leases were not in the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as a whole because the Associations were giving away their control of the management of the tenancies of the individual residents to the Commonwealth which was outside the objectives of each Housing Association. This control was being given away for $1 per year and there was no guarantee by the Minister that any part of the proposed expenditure of $100 million in respect of the town camps would be allocated to any particular or specific Housing Association. It was further submitted that the 40 year sub-leases did not protect the current rights of occupancy of the tenants under their tenancy agreements; (b) The constitutions of the Housing Associations constituted contracts with their members and the entry of the Housing Associations into the sub-leases would be contrary to the objectives of the Housing Associations and would therefore constitute a breach of their constitutions which the Minister was inducing; (c) The decision to enter into the 40 year sub-leases was ultra vires the Housing Associations; (d) The management committee of each Housing Association was in breach of the fiduciary duty they owed to the Association and its members by agreeing to enter into the sub-leases. (e) The entry by the Housing Associations into the sub-leases constituted a breach of contract as the sub-leases would constitute a breach of the individual tenancy agreements of the tenants of the Housing Associations; (f) The Minister was engaging in the tort of intimidation by unlawful means in that she was intimidating the Housing Associations to enter into the sub-leases when she had not accorded procedural fairness to the individual tenants; (g) Section 20CA of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act had not been complied with as the Housing Associations were required to make a request to the Minister to enter into the sub-leases but that request had to be voluntary. The requests made by the Housing Associations were not voluntary. In the circumstances as they developed in the course of the hearing I do not consider that it is necessary to reach a conclusion whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to each of the causes of action relied upon by the applicants. I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that if they now enter into the sub-leases the Housing Associations will not be acting in the interests of their members as a whole thereby giving rise to a cause of action under s 109 of the Associations Act and s 166 of the Aboriginal Corporations Act. Under their Constitutions the only way a person can become a member of the relevant Housing Association is if that person is a resident of the town camp which is situated on the land which is comprised in the perpetual lease or Crown Lease held by the Association.,Criminal Case,Murder,0.051,0.022,0.928,0.9371,6.25385
Case749,Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148,"is important to recognise that at this stage of both proceedings, as I am dealing with applications for interlocutory relief, I do not have to make any final determination in respect of the issues raised before the Court. Consistently with established authority I am required to determine whether there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the causes of action raised by the applicants in each proceeding. If I am so satisfied and am satisfied that the applicants will suffer irreparable harm in respect of which damages are not an adequate remedy if an injunction is not granted, it is then necessary to determine whether the balance of convenience favours the grant or refusal of the injunctive relief sought. I am therefore following and applying the process identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153: ""In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction."" Consideration of the first proceeding In relation to the first proceeding the applicants submitted that a breach of the rules of natural justice has occurred or is occurring or is likely to occur in connection with the proposal of the Minister to give the notice pursuant to s 47(1) of the NER Act. The tenants of the Housing Associations will be significantly affected by the proposed decision so that the Minister is obliged to observe the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness and ensure that the tenants are made aware of the manner in which their rights will be affected by the notice and are given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister as to whether or not she should give a notice before she finally makes a decision. The applicants submitted that the power conferred on the Minister by s 47 of the NER Act to issue a notice which had the effect of vesting all rights and interests in the land to which the notice related with the Commonwealth (see s 47(3)), was subject to a duty imposed upon the Minister to accord procedural fairness or natural justice to the applicants. It was submitted that that duty had not been observed in the present circumstances as the tenants had not been made fully aware of the consequence of the notice on their rights to occupy the land which they sub-leased from the Housing Associations and that they had not been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister in respect of her proposal to give such a notice. The Minister submitted that the power given to the Minister pursuant to s 47 was not constrained by any obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants whose rights would be affected, indeed extinguished, by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 47. The Minister acknowledged that generally one would expect that a power of the kind contained in s 47 would be subject to a duty to accord procedural fairness and that the Commonwealth's power to acquire land by compulsion contained in the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (Cth) ("" Lands Acquisition Act "") was generally subject to an obligation to notify affected parties. The Minister then submitted that the NER Act was enacted with a view to a need to respond urgently to a national emergency and that s 47 was enacted as a separate power and that the usual procedural provisions in the Lands Acquisition Act were expressly put aside in relation to acquisitions under s 47. In this context the Minister referred to s 50(2) of the NER Act. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) and (2) of the NER Act excluded written and unwritten natural justice obligations. The Minister submitted that s 50(1) was an unambiguous statement that the s 47 power was not constrained, even by an unwritten law that might otherwise support an implication for a natural justice obligation. The Minister submitted that it was plain that the legislative expressly turned its mind to, and excluded, procedural fairness that was expressed in written law. I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that this is not the proper construction and effect of s 50. Put another way, I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the provisions of s 47 of the NER Act taken with the provisions of s 50 do not oust the obligation cast upon the Minister to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants who will be affected by the proposed notice. I consider it is arguable that s 50 is concerned with laws whether written or unwritten which are inconsistent with the provisions of Div 1 and Div 2 of the Act. I consider that it is clearly arguable that the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness are not inconsistent with the exercise of power to give a notice under s 47. As the applicants submitted, it is arguable that natural justice is an adjunct to the exercise of that power.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.124,0.051,0.825,0.9974,6.4178999999999995
Case750,Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550,"is a well established principle that a statute will not be construed as excluding the operation of common law principles such as the obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness in appropriate circumstances unless there is a clear and unambiguous statement or inference to that effect to be extracted from the relevant legislation. In Kioa v West (1985) 159 CLR 550 Mason J said at 584 - 585: ""The law has now developed to a point where it may be accepted that there is a common law duty to act fairly, in the sense of according procedural fairness, in the making of administrative decisions which affect rights, interests and legitimate expectations, subject only to the clear manifestation of a contrary statutory intention. ... Where the decision in question is one for which provision is made by statute, the application and content of the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly depends to a large extent on the construction of the statute. In Mobil Oil Australia Pty. Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1) Kitto J. pointed out that the obligation to give a fair opportunity to parties in controversy to correct or contradict statements prejudicial to their view depends on 'the particular statutory framework'. What is appropriate in terms of natural justice depends on the circumstances of the case and they will include, inter alia, the nature of the inquiry, the subject-matter, and the rules under which the decision-maker is acting: Reg. v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ; Ex parte Angliss Group (2) ; National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd (3) . ... When the doctrine of natural justice or the duty to act fairly in its application to administrative decision-making is so understood, the need for a strong manifestation of contrary statutory intention in order for it to be excluded becomes apparent. The critical question in most cases is not whether the principles of natural justice apply. It is: what does the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular case? It will be convenient to consider at the outset whether the statute displaces the duty when the statute contains a specific provision to that effect, for then it will be pointless to inquire what the duty requires in the circumstances of the case, unless there are circumstances not contemplated by the statutory provision that may give rise to a legitimate expectation. However, in general, it will be a matter of determining what the duty to act fairly requires in the way of procedural fairness in the circumstances of the case. A resolution of that question calls for an examination of the statutory provisions and the interests which I have already mentioned."" With that background I consider that there is a serious question to be tried that the Minister has not accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness at this point in time in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47. The proposal to give the s 47 notice was first raised or articulated clearly by the Minister in the letter of 24 May 2009. Prior to that time there had been numerous consultations and dialogue between the Minister and the representatives of the Housing Associations and the tenants but that was in relation to the proposal that the Housing Associations enter into 40 year sub-leases. Whether the Minister has accorded the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness in relation to her proposal to give a notice under s 47 is to be determined by her conduct and the conduct of her department on and after 24 May 2009. I consider there is a serious question to be tried that the media release, the letters sent by the Minister to the Council and to the Housing Associations, the meetings held subsequently with some of the tenants and other persons and the leaflet distributions have not been sufficient to discharge the Minister's obligation to bring to the attention of all the tenants the manner in which the proposed notice will affect their rights. There is also a serious question to be tried that they have not been given a proper opportunity to make submissions to the Minister. I am not satisfied that a process or procedure has been adopted whereby sufficient attempts were made to bring these matters to the attention of all the tenants. The evidence before me is insufficient to satisfy me that all the tenants have been given an opportunity to make submissions to the Minister and have had fairly and squarely put before them the consequences of the Minister giving a notice pursuant to s 47. The leaflets do not make it clear that the tenants' rights to occupy their properties by way of sub-leases will be extinguished forever. Further, this was not made clear at the meeting on 29 June 2009 or in the leaflets that were distributed in the town camps. I accept the Minister's submission that the content of natural justice is to be determined by reference to the circumstances of the case: Kioa v West [supra]. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried that the content of the natural justice principle in the circumstances of this case requires that the tenants be told directly, and not indirectly through the Housing Associations or the Council, that a consequence of the giving of the notice is the extinguishment of their rights to occupy their houses. The Minister submitted that a decision to acquire land by compulsion might in the ordinary case be regarded as having grave consequences for a person holding an interest in the land but that in the present case the evidence disclosed that the practical effect of a decision by the Minister to acquire the land pursuant to s 47 was substantially different to the ordinary case. The Minister submitted that the reality was that there would only be a beneficial impact on the living conditions of the town camp inhabitants. The difficulty with that submission is that it ignores, or it does not take into account, the fact that there will be an extinguishment of tenants' rights of occupation of their houses. To submit, as the Minister did, that ""subject to new tenancy agreements being necessary, no other legal rights of the applicant or group members are impacted"", is to ignore the fact that enforceable rights are being replaced with an opportunity to negotiate a new tenancy agreement which opportunity depends upon agreement between two parties. The next inquiry to be made is whether the balance of convenience is in favour or against the grant of an injunction. I am satisfied that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until such time as the Court can be satisfied that: (a) the tenants have been given clear and unambiguous information that if the notice is given their tenancy rights over the land they occupy pursuant to their sub-leases will be extinguished forever; and (b) the tenants have been given the opportunity to make submissions to the Minister after they have been given this information. I do not intend to prescribe the process which the Minister should undertake in order to discharge her obligations to accord the tenants natural justice or procedural fairness. What I am disposed to do is to grant an injunction restraining the Minister from giving a notice pursuant to s 47 until further order. Such an injunction will enable the Minister to take such steps as she may consider, or she may be advised, will bring to the attention of the tenants the consequences of the giving of the notice and will give them an opportunity to make submissions to her. The injunction will be cast in terms restraining the Minister from giving a notice until further order. It will not be cast in terms restraining the Minister from taking any steps in and towards the giving of the notice.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.126,0.026,0.848,0.9993,6.397550000000001

The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company"" (Citations omitted) The Housing Associations have made it clear that the reason or, at least the main reason, why they propose to enter into 40 year sub-leases with the Director is to avoid the alternative of the Minister exercising power under s 47 of the NER Act to give notice which will have the effect of extinguishing forever the interests of the Housing Associations in the relevant pieces of land. The attitude of the Housing Associations on this issue was made abundantly clear in a letter from their solicitors to the Minister on 29 July 2009 which was, inter alia, in the following terms: ""As you know, and as we are now instructed to make clear, the Housing Associations are prepared to enter into the proposed 40 year subleases notwithstanding your rejection of their many requests for the inclusion of terms and conditions designed to further protect the ongoing interests of the Housing Associations, tenants and residents. The Housing Associations have agreed to enter into the subleases for the simple reason that you have threatened them with compulsory acquisition if they do not enter into the subleases. As you know, the loss of tenure to these lands is something that is abhorrent to the Housing Associations and they could not run the risk that it might occur. It is in the overriding best interests of the Associations and their members that their interests in these lands be maintained rather than completely foregone. Acquisitions of these land would not allow the Associations or members to have any input into protecting their rights or interests. Indeed, this ultimate risk of compulsory acquisition has hovered in the background throughout the protected negotiations. That risk was made abundantly clear when you issued notice that you were considering these compulsory acquisitions. Likewise, your letter to Tangentyere dated 24 July 2009 makes it perfectly clear that unless the subleases are entered into in the terms attached to your letter then you will proceed in relation to the potential compulsory acquisitions."" Counsel for the Housing Associations submitted that it was in the overriding best interests of the Housing Associations and the tenants of the Housing Associations to retain their perpetual leases and not to have their titles extinguished by compulsory acquisition. He submitted initially that the Housing Associations were prepared to grant the sub-leases to the Director for two reasons. Firstly, because it appeared that it was the only way that Commonwealth funding would be provided. Secondly, because it was the only way to avoid compulsory acquisition.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.106,0.05,0.843,0.9791,6.367850000000001

Case758,Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1,"Ms Collins then submitted that a balancing exercise was involved, essentially between the forensic significance of the material and the harm that would be done to the public good by disclosure. In essence, Mr Halley accepted that proposition the correctness of which is borne out by a recent judgment of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Limited (2008) 169 FCR 227 at 232 [22]. The Full Court (Heerey, Moore and Tracey JJ) set out the well known passage from Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38-39, which was in these terms: The court must decide which aspect of the public interest predominates, or in other words whether the public interest which requires that the document should not be produced outweighs the public interest that a court of justice in performing its functions should not be denied access to relevant evidence. 10 Quite apart from the Full Court's decision to that effect, I am, of course, bound by what was said in Sankey v Whitlam . Ms Collins then submitted that I should take into account the clear relevance of the material to the present proceedings. She submitted that the relevance was plain from the terms of the notice to produce. The notice to produce was in the following terms: 1. All documents provided to Mr David McGuinness on or before 10 October 2008 in relation to the decision or opinion recorded in the letter from Ms Dodds and Mr Astar to Atanaskovic Hartnell dated 10 October 2008 that it will not be possible for the First, Second and Third Applicants to have the same legal representatives, or different representatives each from Atanaskovic Hartnell, at their examinations under section 19 of the ASIC Act ("" the Decision ""). 2. All documents provided to Mr McGuinness in relation to the Reasons for the Decision pursuant to s.13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act Re: Legal Representation of Mr Collard, Ms Li and Ms Zeng at their Examinations pursuant to s.19 of the ASIC Act signed by him and dated 22 October 2008. ASIC produced MFI 1 in answer to both paragraphs of that notice to produce. In Ms Collins' submission, it followed that the relevance of the material was established. 11 Mr Halley submitted, broadly speaking, that perhaps not that much could be gleaned from production, particularly where the issues in the proceedings were effectively about whether a particular administrative decision should be set aside. I approach the matter on the basis that the documents are relevant. However, beyond that, there is little that can usefully be said. Ms Collins submitted that the balancing exercise should take into account the possibility that a confidentiality regime could be fashioned which would limit access to the Applicants' advisors. In her submission, it was significant that Mr McGuinness did not say in his affidavit that such a regime could not work. 12 Mr Halley submitted that disclosure to the legal representatives should not occur due to the risk of inadvertent disclosure. Further, he submitted that a legal representative holding such information might be compromised even if only subconsciously. I do not read too much into the fact that Mr McGuiness did not deal with the possible alternative of a confidentiality regime, particularly where it was agreed that he should not be cross-examined. I do think that there may be risks of unintended subconscious disclosure. However, the extent of the risk is difficult to discern without viewing the documents. Ms Collins then submitted that to the extent that informers were involved, their names and any other identifying aspects of the materials could be redacted.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.022,0.908,0.9751,6.364850000000001
Case759,Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40,"Ms Collins, who appeared for the Applicants, submitted first that the Court should examine the documents in MFI 1 for itself to determine the claim. On the other hand, Mr Halley SC, who appeared with Ms Allars for ASIC, submitted that in the first instance the Court should determine the matter on the affidavit of Mr McGuinness and only if it proves not possible to determine the claim should the Court look at the material. In the event that the claim was not obvious from that process, the Court should permit further evidence to be put on. Mr Halley drew particular attention to that which had fallen from Gummow J in the decision of the Full Federal Court in Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 at 61: Where a claim has not been propounded in proper form, the court has various avenues open to it before taking its final decision in the matter. It may order that unless within a specified time a further affidavit be sworn within a specified time which shows the claim to privilege with greater particularity, the documents in question should be produced for inspection ... The court may call for a further affidavit from the same deponent to clarify some point or amplify the claim; or it may require the tender of an affidavit sworn by a more senior officer or the relevant Minister. 8 Mr Halley says that the documents contained in MFI 1 are pertinent to an ongoing investigation and that, generally speaking, they would be covered by public interest immunity. In my opinion, Mr Halley's submissions on this are to be preferred. Generally, if a claim for public interest immunity can be substantiated without the Court seeing the material, that is the preferable course. This is particularly so in relation to certain classes of documents such as cabinet documents. In view of the exigencies of the present situation, if that affidavit does not suffice, however, I will inspect the documents myself, notwithstanding what was said by Gummow J in Zarro . If that does not suffice, then I will permit a further affidavit to be filed. 15 By itself, I do not think that this explanation is sufficient for me to form a view that the documents are the proper subject of a claim for public interest immunity. More is that so where it does not appear from Mr McGuinness' affidavit that he has, in fact, examined the documents himself. I propose, therefore, to examine this document in due course. I am fortified in that approach by what was said by Lockhart J in Zarro v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40 at 50-51: In these days with large government instrumentalities and agencies involved in time consuming and extensive investigations into possible irregularities and offences, great care is required by the bodies themselves in ensuring both that the correct person within the structure of the organisation (that is, a person who knows the facts, has seen the documents and who is preferably at a high level within the organisation) swears the appropriate affidavit claiming public interest immunity and that the claim is not made too widely so as to sweep within its net documents that are not legitimately an essential integer in the investigative process. This also calls for vigilance by the courts lest documents are shielded from public scrutiny or inspection by parties to litigation under an unduly broad umbrella of public interest immunity. 16 Document 2 is an email from Ms Hayden to Ms Dodds of 4 September 2008, attaching a spreadsheet. Ms Dodds is a solicitor within the Commission. Mr McGuinness says that the email contains the work of an ASIC officer, which work is derived from the information in document 1. He says that it should be the subject of a public interest immunity claim on that basis. For the same reasons which obtain in the case of Document 1, I propose to examine document 2. 17 Document 3 is a file note of Ms Dodds of 8 September 2008, recording a conversation she had with members of the public. Ms Collins sought clarification during the course of the hearing that they were not the same discussions of which evidence, apparently, has already been filed in Supreme Court proceedings. ASIC gave that assurance. The information in the document was obtained voluntarily in circumstances where its donors would not have appreciated that their information would be given to the Applicants. Disclosure would imperil the future gathering of such information. Mr McGuinness also thought that if this information was known to the Applicants they may be able to tailor their evidence in response. It might also tip them off as to the line of inquiry being pursued. 20 I will not describe in any detail the content of document 1. Mr McGuinness says these documents have a tendency to reveal the course of the investigation. I am, unfortunately, unable to tell from looking at them the extent of the truth of that proposition. The same may be said of documents 2, 3 and 5. For present purposes, I have resealed MFI 1 and I direct that it not be opened by any person apart from myself or as ordered by another judge of this Court. Having regard to what was said by Gummow J in Zarro , I propose to allow ASIC to provide to the Court a confidential affidavit setting out what it is that is in documents 1, 2, 3 and 5 that makes them the subject of a proper claim for public interest immunity. That affidavit is to be given to my associate in a sealed envelope by 4 pm tomorrow. 21 The envelope is not to be opened by any person other than myself or as directed by another judge of the Court. The affidavit is not to be served on the Applicants nor filed through the registry. I will deliver a separate judgment at 9.30 am on Monday 27 October 2008. [ There was further discussion with counsel. ] 22 I amend the deadline in respect of the affidavit to be 4 pm on Monday 27 October 2008. I will deliver judgment at 9.30 am on Tuesday 28 October 2008.

Case762,"Oayda v Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, Wilcox J, 20 February 1995)","inquired of counsel for the applicants as to the source of the power to make the order sought in para 4 of the orders by consent. The effect of that order, in conjunction with para 3, would be to cast upon the respondent personal liability for the costs of this proceeding by preventing him from reimbursing himself from the bankrupt estate. In my view, it is appropriate that the respondent assume personal liability for the costs of the application. Counsel for the applicants referred me to the judgment of Wilcox J in Oayda v Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, Wilcox J, 20 February 1995) in which his Honour made an order the effect of which was to require a trustee in bankruptcy to pay costs personally, when the trustee in bankruptcy had acted wrongly in relation to a proof of debt. On considering the question, I think that s 179(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act provides me with sufficient authority to make an order ensuring that the respondent will bear the costs personally. For these reasons, I make the following orders by consent, that: Pursuant to s 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), the respondent is removed as trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of Ramadan Alievski. Pursuant to s 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), Gess Rambaldi of Level 19, 15 William Street, Melbourne, Victoria, be appointed as trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of Ramadan Alievski in place of the respondent.

Assertion is not proof. There are equally stern denials made in the responses to those assertions by the respondent's solicitors. As counsel for the applicants put it, an essential element of the claim is that Dr Minas is using the algorithm forming part of the applicants' system. There remains a possibility that he has created a new algorithm, and the applicants, reasonably, in my opinion, wants to obtain forensic examination to eliminate that possibility before making a final decision whether to commence proceedings.

Case766,Harrington-Smith on behalf of The Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002 FCA 184,"WAFIC has been named as a respondent in some other native title determination applications in Western Australia, the District Registrar who received its notice of intention to become a party to the Amangu application referred the matter to a judge because of a decision of Lindgren J refusing an application by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia to be joined as a party in the Wongatha proceedings Harrington-Smith on behalf of The Wongatha People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 184. In the notice of intention to become a party lodged by WAFIC on 28 July 2005, it gave details of its interest thus: Application may have an adverse effect on the rights and interests of the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (Inc) as set out in Attachment A.' Attachment A to the notice identified WAFIC as the peak industry body for the fishing industry in Western Australia. It referred to its role of liaising with government on behalf of its members in connection with the management of various fisheries. Some of those fisheries are located in the claim area. WAFIC's role and function as liaison with government in relation to policies and issues concerning the fishing and pearling industries was said to depend on: the managed fisheries in a particular area; the number of its members operating in that area; and the ability of its members to access the fisheries in that area.' It was submitted that the function of various committees and WAFIC's role on those committees constituted an interest capable of being affected by the native title claim. If the claim were made out WAFIC's role in advising government in relation to issues raised by the committees would be affected as the rights of its members would be affected by the declaration of co-existing rights or by the declaration that no rights exist. It described its role in those committees as 'political' in that it plays a part in the political process of lobbying or at least making recommendations to government. In Harrington-Smith , Lindgren J referred to the Byron Environment Centre case and the Woodridge decision and said (at 2): do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases, beyond noting that they establish that a society, organisation, association or other body which voices, protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not, by reason of that circumstance alone, have ""interests [which] may be affected by a determination in the proceedings"" for the purposes of subs 84(5) of the Act.' Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, his Honour refused its application for joinder.

Case767,Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1,"leading case on the range of 'interests' which confer standing under the Act is Byron Environment Centre Inc v Arakwal People (1997) 78 FCR 1. That case concerned the party provisions of the Act in effect before the 1998 amendments. They were ss 68 and 69 . The decision, however, remains authoritative for the similarly worded party provisions in s 84. In that decision the Full Court held that the interests which could be affected by a determination in relation to an application for native title and thus give rise to an entitlement to party status are not confined to the interests in land or waters which are referred to in s 253 of the Act. Black CJ held that the interest sufficient to give a person the right to become a party to an application should be greater than that of a member of the general public. They must be genuine and the possible effect must be genuine. The Parliament could not have contemplated that the rights given to persons as parties would have other than a genuine foundation. His Honour said (at 7): nature and content of the right to become a party to proceedings for the determination of native title, with the power as a party in effect to veto the process of mediation and conciliation which the Act favours, suggests that the interests with which s 68(2)(a) and the related sections dealing with parties are concerned are interests that are not indirect, remote or lacking substance. The nature and content of the right also suggests that the interests must be capable of clear definition and, equally importantly, that they are of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the application.' The requisite interest did not need to be proprietary, legal or equitable. He said (at 7): the interests must be genuine and not indirect, remote or lacking substance, there is no indication that, for example, a person who has a special, well-established non-proprietary connection with land or waters which is of significance to that person is not be regarded as having interests that may be affected by a determination. To the contrary, the consensual objects of the Act would seem to be advanced if a person with genuine interests of that nature that might or would be affected did have the rights of involvement in the process of native title determination given by the Act to a person who is a party. Each case will of course turn on its own facts and whether or not interests will or may be affected will depend upon an assessment of the interaction between the interests asserted by a person who wants to be a party and the nature and extent of the native title rights and interests claimed.' The concept of interest did not extend to interests of 'an emotional conscientious, ideological or intellectual kind only'. Relevantly his Honour also said (at 9): formation of an association or the incorporation of a body with particular objects will not, of itself, create interests that may be affected for the purposes of provisions in the Act relating to parties. ... a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected, does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected; such interests as it thereby has are wholly indirect. is not to deny that a corporation may have interests that may be affected by a determination of native title if, for example, its activities might be curtailed or otherwise significantly affected by the determination.' In Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527, Katz J considered the proposed joinder of the New South Wales Farmers' Association pursuant to a notification under s 84(3)(b) of the Act. His Honour denied the Association party status on the basis that it had failed to establish its possession of interests which might be affected by a native title determination in either sense of: (a) proprietary or contractual interests in the land the subject of the application; or (b) conducting activities which may be adversely affected by such a determination. His Honour held, following the judgments in Byron Environment Centre that a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected. Katz J distinguished the Gunai decision and its acceptance by Lockhart J on the basis that the Lake Tyers Beach Sports and Angling Club was not a legal person, separate from its individual members. His Honour said that to recognise 'the Club' as a party was simply an informal method of recognising its individual members as parties. He observed that Lockhart J appeared to be conscious of the Club's unincorporated status. In Harrington-Smith , Lindgren J referred to the Byron Environment Centre case and the Woodridge decision and said (at 2): do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases, beyond noting that they establish that a society, organisation, association or other body which voices, protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not, by reason of that circumstance alone, have ""interests [which] may be affected by a determination in the proceedings"" for the purposes of subs 84(5) of the Act.' Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, his Honour refused its application for joinder. See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 (Mansfield J). It is clear from the authority of the Full Court decision in Byron Environment Centre that WAFIC cannot acquire party status by reason of the possible effects of a native title determination on the interests of its members. It asserts, however, that it has an affected interest by reason of its participation in statutory committees advising government in relation to managed fisheries, some of which exist in the claim area. It does not appear to me however that this function, carried out on the part of WAFIC, can be compared to that of a statutory authority with direct responsibility for the management of an area the subject of a native title determination application. WAFIC's involvement as described in its submissions and supporting evidence, seems to relate to advice to government on policy for the management of the relevant fisheries. No evidence is shown which logically link the economic interests of WAFIC as an organisation to a native title determination in the claim area. Nor am I satisfied that the evidence discloses any real basis upon which WAFIC's capacity to participate in the committees to which it has referred would be affected. In so saying, I accept that WAFIC has been joined as party in some applications without any contention and has acted as agent in others. It has played a valuable role in the submissions that it has made in such cases, not least in the Bardi Jawi case which I heard as trial judge, albeit WAFIC had been joined by order of Lee J. In my opinion however, I am bound by the authority in Byron Environment Centre to reject WAFIC's application for joinder as a party. It may of course act as agent on behalf of a party in relation to the proceeding. That does not require the intervention of the Court. Under s 84B a party to a proceeding can appoint an organisation as its agent. WAFIC's application for joinder is therefore refused. The same considerations arise in relation to the Ngarla Peoples' claim and again, WAFIC's application for joinder in that claim will be refused. I note that among the proposals for amendments to the Act arising out of the recent Commonwealth Government review is a proposal under which industry bodies could be joined as parties. In my opinion, provided that their participation is confined to the representation of their member interest holders in matters directly relevant to the impact of a native title determination on those interests, then the capacity to effect such a joinder may be a useful facility.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.157,0.044,0.799,0.9994,6.3849
Case768,"Re An Application for Native Title Determination by the Gunai People (unreported, National Native Title Tribunal, 17 January 1997, French P)","J, like Black CJ, rejected a construction of the party provisions of the Act which would limit their application to persons with legal or proprietary interests. His Honour said (16): who may not have a right or interest in the land in a proprietary sense, but nevertheless have an interest in a broader sense, will be entitled to have a say in the matter and be able to negotiate some arrangement to accommodate their interests if they are parties to the application, which is the question arising in this case.' His Honour referred, without disapproval, to my decision, as President of the National Native Title Tribunal, in relation to the Gunai Peoples' native title determination application in 1997 allowing joinder of the Lake Tyers Beach Sport and Angling Club which comprised: 65 members who use the waters and surrounding areas of Lake Tyers daily for recreational fishing.' An Application for Native Title Determination by the Gunai People (unreported, National Native Title Tribunal, 17 January 1997, French P) Lockhart J said that the standing provision was not to be encased in technical rules. The class of interests for which it provides is wider than that defined by s 253 and it would be impossible and unwise to attempt to define the class in any definitive sense. It would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case (at 19): interest must be above that of an ordinary member of the public, and must be not that of a mere intermeddler or busybody. The person must have some interest that may be affected by the native title determination. The persons who sought the status of parties before French J in the Gunai application provide a good example of persons with a relevant interest for the purposes of s 68(2)(a). If it be said that this is too broad an analysis and that the floodgates will open, then I must say that over the past 18 years on the Bench of this Court I have never seen the floodgates open in any matter, despite dire predictions to the contrary.' In Woodridge v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2001] FCA 419 ; (2001) 108 FCR 527, Katz J considered the proposed joinder of the New South Wales Farmers' Association pursuant to a notification under s 84(3)(b) of the Act. His Honour denied the Association party status on the basis that it had failed to establish its possession of interests which might be affected by a native title determination in either sense of: (a) proprietary or contractual interests in the land the subject of the application; or (b) conducting activities which may be adversely affected by such a determination. His Honour held, following the judgments in Byron Environment Centre that a body that represents the interests of others whose members have interests that may be affected does not, for that reason alone, become a person whose interests are affected.

Case769,Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria (1996) 1 AILR 482,"J referred to the joinder by Olney J of the Victorian Field and Game Association as a party in the Yorta Yorta application Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria (1996) 1 AILR 482. His Honour also referred to the joinder of the persons and organisations referred to in the Gunai Peoples' case. He observed that the 10 groups of persons and organisations admitted as parties in that case included frequent recreational users of the land and waters covered by the claim, commercial entities said to be dependent for their livelihood upon continuing recreational use of the claimed area by local persons and visitors, property owners entitled to free access to parts of the area claimed and sporting and angling clubs or associations which are the conducted sporting, shooting or angling activities in parts of the claimed areas or had members who frequently or habitually engaged in such activities. In relation to the standing of organisations representing persons whose interests might be affected, Merkel J said (at 43): an individual lacks the requisite interest the position cannot be improved or altered by an application to be a party being made by an organisation representing many such individuals.' His Honour went on, however, to say that (at 43): problem arising in respect of an organisation representing members who have interests that may be affected by a determination is that the interests of the organisation are indirect. Put another way, it is the interests of members, rather than those of an organisation representing them, that may be affected.' His Honour further observed (at 43): different situation might arise if such organisations themselves conduct activities in the area covered by the claim which may be curtailed, interfered with or otherwise affected by a determination. In such cases there is no reason in principle why such organisations may not be persons whose interests may be affected by a determination.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.152,0.043,0.805,0.9893,6.35355

His Honour said that to recognise 'the Club' as a party was simply an informal method of recognising its individual members as parties. He observed that Lockhart J appeared to be conscious of the Club's unincorporated status. In Harrington-Smith , Lindgren J referred to the Byron Environment Centre case and the Woodridge decision and said (at 2): do not find it necessary to refer to the discussion of the matter in those cases, beyond noting that they establish that a society, organisation, association or other body which voices, protects or promotes the concerns and interests of its members does not, by reason of that circumstance alone, have ""interests [which] may be affected by a determination in the proceedings"" for the purposes of subs 84(5) of the Act.' Applying that proposition to the position of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, his Honour refused its application for joinder. See also Adnyamatha People v South Australia [2003] FCA 1377 ; (2003) 133 FCR 242 (Mansfield J). In the present case WAFIC does not take issue with what Lindgren J drew from Byron Environmental Centre and Woodridge . Rather, WAFIC contended that its factual position differed from that of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy in a material way. It relied in particular upon WAFIC's representation on, and participation in, advisory committees established under the FRMA. This participation, it was said, included representing the interests of its members by presenting and promoting its members' views with respect to fishery management and protection policy and acting as an intermediary between government and industry. It referred to the formulation of cohesive industry policy. It was contended that WAFIC's participation in these committees is essentially in its own right and on behalf of 'industry' and not merely on behalf of any particular member of WAFIC. An impact on fisheries in the claim area would or could have an effect on management of fisheries outside or partly outside the claim area. WAFIC submitted that the cases which suggest that an industry body does not have an entitlement to participate in the native title claim in its own right have not dealt with an industry body with statutory functions in resource management under existing statutes. It also referred to Nicholson J's decision to allow WAFIC's application to be joined in Ngaluma Ingibandi and it was submitted that unless the view was formed that Nicholson J was clearly in error in allowing WAFIC's notice, then WAFIC ought to be joined as a party to the claim. However, the basis upon which his Honour made the joinder order is not evident as there were no reasons published for the decision. In the alternative, WAFIC submitted that it should be '... joined as a party as agent for specified parties under s 84B of the Native Title Act '. This submission misconceives the operation of s 84B which provides: A party to a proceeding may appoint a society, organisation, association or other body to act as agent on behalf of the party in relation to the proceeding. The same body may act as agent for 2 or more parties in the same proceeding.'

Case772,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"line between a claim apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal and a claim which depends for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal may not always be easy to detect. However, I think it is clear on which side of the line this case falls because the case now put is quite a different one to the case put to the Tribunal. In my respectful opinion, the words of Gleeson CJ in Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at 479 [1] are apposite: ""Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial; and issues are not defined by pleadings, or any analogous process. Even so, this Court has insisted that, on judicial review, a decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made, not upon an entirely different basis which may occur to an applicant, or an applicant's lawyers, at some later stage in the process."" In applying the relevant principles to the facts, it is worth repeating the facts as to how the appellant has formulated his claims at various stages. In this application for a protection visa, the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because he was a male member of his family and he was at risk of being killed by members of an opposing family. A blood feud had arisen as a result of disputes over land ownership. Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because: (1) he is a member of a particular social group (""male Albanian child"") and will suffer persecution because of that membership; or (2) he is a member of a particular social group (""Kulak (landowner) family"") and he will suffer persecution because of that membership; or (3) he has an imputed political opinion by reason of his membership of the group referred to in (2) and he will suffer persecution because of that political opinion. Before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant maintained the claims he had made before the Tribunal. In essence, the appellant's submission was that the Tribunal erred in not making findings as to whether there were particular social groups properly described as ""male Albanian child"" and ""Kulak (landowner) family"". That submission was rejected. On appeal to this Court, the appellant reformulated his claim. As I understood his submission, he accepts that he is now putting his claim on the ground that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group consisting of his family, and that s 91S of the Act must be considered. The appellant also accepts that his well-founded fear of persecution arises because of events surrounding the conduct of Uncle Ded on 25 April 1997. The appellant's argument is put in this way. The relevant family member for the purposes of a consideration of the effect of s 91S is Uncle Ded. However, he has a Convention reason for his fear of persecution because he fears persecution for reasons of his membership of a particular social group, being ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The submission is that there was no reason to disregard Uncle Ded's fear of persecution, and no reason to disregard the appellant's fear of persecution. It followed that the appellant's fear of persecution arose because of his membership of a particular social group, being his family. The Tribunal failed to consider this claim and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. There are a number of reasons why the appellant's argument must be rejected. First, the appellant, with legal assistance and the advantage of the Tribunal's decision in relation to his parents' claims, formulated social groups for the purpose of the Tribunal hearing that were quite different from those formulated in this appeal. Namely, they did not relate to his family and the actions of one particular member of the family. The social groups formulated by the appellant avoided altogether (in terms of the formulation of the social group) an examination of the appellant's family and the actions of one particular member of the family. This point is not decisive, but it is a relevant consideration.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.021,0.075,0.904,-0.9832,-0.3872

It is artificial because it is very general and because it seems to me it could be formulated in a number of other ways.

Case774,AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1506,"is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: AZAAC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1506. On 11 November 2008, that Court dismissed an application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""). The appellant is a male child who was born on 3 June 2004. He was born in Australia and, by reason of the fact that his parents are Albanian nationals, his nationality is Albanian. Throughout the administrative and legal processes which followed his application for a Protection (Class XA) visa (""protection visa""), his father has acted on his behalf. The appellant lodged an application for a protection visa on 28 June 2007. On 23 July 2007, his application was refused by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. He applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision. In a decision handed down on 3 December 2007, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. On the application made by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs, a federal magistrate held that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error, and dismissed the application.

Case775,Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389,"the federal magistrate, the appellant contended that the Tribunal member had made two errors. First, she had not determined at the outset whether the particular social groups advanced by the appellant were particular social groups for the purposes of the Convention and therefore she had not followed the steps laid down in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389. This error was not said by the appellant to be fatal of itself, but when combined with other errors it was significant. As I understand the federal magistrate's reasons, he accepted that the Tribunal had not made findings about these matters, but he held that this had not led to jurisdictional error. Secondly, it was submitted that the Tribunal member had erred in not undertaking an examination of whether there was a causative link between the fear and the motive for persecution. The Tribunal had failed to consider the evidence relevant to the objective ascertainment of the motives of those who were responsible for the persecution. In rejecting the appellant's argument, the federal magistrate said: ""The Tribunal expressly considered the claim that the applicant fears harm as a result of being a child in Albania. It evaluated the evidence presented by the parents on behalf of that claim and examined the country information as well and came to a conclusion that the risks presented to the child stemmed from the blood feud. I can readily conceive of cases where dealing with the subjective element and then the nexus between that and the convention related harm simply upon the basis of an attribution to the child of parental fears would give rise to a jurisdictional error. They would be circumstances where, for example, there was material before the Tribunal providing an objective basis for the fear which is attributed to the child being held for a convention related reason. The only material available to the Tribunal here was either country information that did not relate to convention-related persecution or material that indicated that the perceived harm arose from the existence of the blood feud and its consequences."" The grounds of appeal to this Court The original notice of appeal contained five grounds of appeal. Shortly prior to the hearing, the appellant forwarded to the Court an amended notice of appeal which raised three further grounds of appeal. The three further grounds of appeal were that the federal magistrate erred in not holding that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by reason of: ""(e) finding that the 'other member' of the family of the Appellant for the purposes of s 91S(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Uncle Ded) did not suffer fear or persecution for a Convention reason (see Tribunal decision page 19.4 AB 189.4). Particulars The Uncle was a member of the particular social group of Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property. He feared persecution for reason of membership of that particular social group, and further feared that he would receive no protection from the Albanian State, and consequently he had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution. (f) not determining that State prosecution was not available for those in danger of reprisals, when evidence had been led to that effect. (g) not determining that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution, at least hypothetically, for a Convention reason."" In essence, the appellant claims that the Tribunal member committed a jurisdictional error by failing to consider whether Uncle Ded had a Convention reason for his fear of persecution, namely, his membership of a particular social group, being ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The Tribunal member had said that Uncle Ded's fear of persecution arose from the shooting incident and was not Convention related. Of course, there are a number of other issues in addition to the question of whether a particular social group exists for the purposes of the Convention. In Dranichnikov , Gummow and Callinan JJ said (at 394 [26]): ""At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps. First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."" There is also the issue of State protection. In this case, I do not need to consider the other issues and the issue of State protection because I have reached the conclusion that the Tribunal did not err in not identifying and considering whether Uncle Ded belonged to a particular social group described as ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"". The claim now made in relation to Uncle Ded was not expressly articulated before the Tribunal and it was not dealt with by the Tribunal. The principles concerning the Tribunal's obligation to deal with claims before it are clear, although their application may give rise to difficulties. I should say that I do not think the principles or their application differ because the claim for membership of a particular social group is made in relation to a third party (Uncle Ded) and not the appellant himself. In Dranichnikov , the Tribunal had not considered a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts, that being whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals (at 394 [24] per Gummow and Callinan JJ). The Tribunal had in fact considered another question which was whether the applicant's membership of a social group being ""businessmen in Russia"" was a reason for persecution and relevantly nothing more. In taking that approach, the Tribunal had constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction (at 394 [25] per Gummow and Callinan JJ; at 406 [86] per Kirby J; at 408 [95] per Hayne J). The Tribunal's obligation to consider a claim extends beyond those claims which have been clearly articulated. The question of the extent of the Tribunal's obligation to consider a claim not clearly articulated before it was considered in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1. The Full Court of this Court (Black CJ, French and Selway JJ) said (at 18 [58] and 22 [68]): ""The review process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Tribunal is required to deal with the case raised by the material or evidence before it: Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1901 ; (2000) 106 FCR 157 at [114] (Merkel J). There is authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is not to limit its determination to the ""case"" articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated: Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1693 ; (1998) 94 FCR 28 at 63 (Merkel J); approved in Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (1999) 90 FCR 287 at 293-294 (Wilcox and Madgwick JJ). By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the Tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sarrazola (No 2) [2001] FCA 263 ; (2001) 107 FCR 184 at 196 per Merkel J, Heerey and Sundberg JJ agreeing. It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised ""squarely"" on the material available to the Tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it: SDAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 120 ; (2003) 129 FCR 137 at [19] per Cooper J. The use of the adverb ""squarely"" does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal. ... Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material before the Tribunal it did not represent, in any way, ""a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts"" in the sense in which that term was used in Dranichnikov . A judgment that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is, as already indicated in these reasons, not lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.056,0.104,0.84,-0.9982,-0.4457

By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the Tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Sarrazola (No 2) [2001] FCA 263 ; (2001) 107 FCR 184 at 196 per Merkel J, Heerey and Sundberg JJ agreeing. It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised ""squarely"" on the material available to the Tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it: SDAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 120 ; (2003) 129 FCR 137 at [19] per Cooper J. The use of the adverb ""squarely"" does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal. ... Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material before the Tribunal it did not represent, in any way, ""a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts"" in the sense in which that term was used in Dranichnikov . A judgment that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is, as already indicated in these reasons, not lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.062,0.037,0.901,0.905,6.1425

Case779,STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556,"appellant had legal assistance in relation to his application to the Tribunal for review. His legal advisers wrote to the Tribunal on 19 September 2007. In their letter, they said that the appellant accepted that, as a result of the High Court's decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556 , the appellant could not claim refugee status on the basis that he is a member of the particular social groups described as ""Albanian citizens who are subject to the customary law"" or ""the [X] family"" which are at risk of persecution because of a blood feud. I use the letter, X, in lieu of the name of the appellant's family. On the appellant's behalf, his legal advisers submitted that he was a refugee on the following grounds: that he is a member of the particular social group being a ""male Albanian child"" and will suffer persecution because of that membership; that he is a member of the particular social group being a ""Kulak (landowner) family"" and will suffer persecution because of that membership; or his imputed political opinion as a member of a Kulak family. The appellant's legal advisers submitted that, although Albanian law does not uphold traditional or customary law, the Albanian authorities are unwilling and unable to protect the appellant from the risk of harm which he faces if he returns to that country. The Tribunal member said that the direct cause of the blood feud was the act of Uncle Ded shooting at members of the Lleshi and Biba families and not for any other reason. The fear of harm resulted from the blood feud and the blood feud would not have arisen without the occurrence of the shooting incident. The Tribunal member said that Uncle Ded's fear of reprisals was for the shooting incident and is not Convention related. As the fear held by the appellant's family member was not Convention related, the threshold question in s 91S(a) was satisfied. The Tribunal member said: ""Therefore, in accordance with subsection 91S(b), any fear of persecution on the basis of being a member of the [X] family on the basis of the shooting incident must be disregarded under section 91S of the Act. As found by the majority in the High Court in STCB v MIMIA &amp; Anor [2006] HCA 61 at [20] in similar circumstances (and acknowledged by the representative), in these circumstances, s 91S is fatal to a claim that the applicant fears persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group that consists of his family."" The Tribunal member said that she did not need to decide if there were particular social groups of the kind advanced by the appellant (""male Albanian child"" or ""Kulak family"") because, in light of her findings of fact, membership of those ""groups"" could not be the reason for the fear of harm. She said that the shooting incident triggered the blood feud which in turn is the reason for the fear of harm. The Tribunal member concluded that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and she was not satisfied that the appellant came within Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention. The federal magistrate's reasons Thirdly, the appellant submitted that Uncle Ded's conduct was clearly not criminal and that a purpose behind the introduction of s 91S was to remove the potential for criminal families to otherwise claim refugee status ( STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 61 ; (2006) 231 ALR 556). However, the evidence before the Tribunal was at the very least equivocal as to whether Uncle Ded's conduct constituted a criminal act. It is true that he was not charged by the police over the shooting incident, but the evidence suggests that Uncle Ded shot at members of the Lleshi and Biba families as they were leaving the property. Again, it is clearly not my task to make findings about these issues. Again, they suggest that the claim now made was not apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. I have considered all the circumstances and I do not think the claim now advanced was apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. In my opinion, the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error in not considering whether there was a social group of ""Albanian householders who had resisted armed encroachment onto their property"" and whether Uncle Ded was a member of such a group.

Case780,Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580,"The Minister is not bound to proceed by reference to the direction under s 499 of the Act, namely, Direction No 21: Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 327 ; (2004) 139 FCR 580 at 585 [31] . However, he may choose to do so. In this case, he said that he would proceed in accordance with the Direction. 20 The applicant submits that the third primary consideration referred to in Direction No 21, namely, the best interests of the child, is only relevant if there is a child. He points to paragraph 2.3(c) set out in [11] above and he also points to the following paragraph in Direction No 21: ""2.13 This consideration only applies if the child is or would be less than 18 years of age at the time when the decision is intended to come into effect. The best interests of any children aged 18 years or more is not a primary consideration but may be considered with other considerations under paragraph 2.17."" 21 It should be noted that Direction No 21 makes it clear that although generally speaking it is in the child's best interests to remain with his or her parent, there may be circumstances in which the best interests are served by separation from the non-citizen.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.111,0.032,0.858,0.9638,6.2973
Case781,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"It was accepted by the applicant that Direction No 21 is ""not so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion"". I think that approach is correct. In other words, where the decision under s 501(2) is made by the Minister, as opposed to his delegate, jurisdictional error is not established simply by showing a misconstruction of Direction No 21; it must be shown that the Minister acted outside the terms of the statutory power. Section 501(2) does not state the matters the Minister must or may take into account in exercising the discretion. In exercising an apparently unconfined discretion the determination of the limits of the statutory power is made having regard to the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the power and the Act in which it appears. In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24, Mason J said at 40: ""In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations, this Court has held that, where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined, the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined, except in so far as there may be found in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard: see Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte 2HD Pty Ltd , adopting the earlier formulations of Dixon J in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury , and Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning . By analogy, where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute, the court will not find that the decision-maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the Act."" (Footnotes omitted.) 27 As I understood it, the applicant also conceded that if all the Minister did was to take into account as a matter in favour of cancelling the applicant's visa the fact that the applicant had no children then although the Minister had misconstrued Direction No 21 that would not constitute a jurisdictional error. I think that concession was correctly made because there is nothing in the nature and purpose of the statutory provisions to indicate that the fact that the applicant had no children is a matter the Minister was prohibited from taking into account. 28 The applicant submits that the Minister in fact made a more serious error than simply taking into account that the applicant had no children and that the error he made was a jurisdictional error. I do not find it easy to articulate the more serious error identified by the applicant but, as I understand it, it was that the Minister had found that the best interests of the children favoured cancellation of the visa when in fact that there were no children. I reject that submission. A fair reading of the Minister's reasons is that he found that the fact that the applicant had no children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa. That was a misconstruction of Direction No 21 but not a jurisdictional error.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.051,0.071,0.878,-0.4809,1.3368499999999996
Case782,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189,"The next question is whether the error of the Minister being a misconstruction of Direction No 21 amounts to jurisdictional error. The applicant referred to the following observations of French and Drummond JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189 at 208: ""If a decision-maker, not bound to apply policy, purports to apply it as a proper basis for disposing of the case in hand but misconstrues or misunderstands it so that what is applied is not the policy but something else, then there may be reviewable error. In a limiting case a policy may be so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion. In such a case misconstruction of the policy may reduce to misconstruction of the statute or misunderstanding of its purpose.""",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.026,0.102,0.871,-0.8894,-0.039899999999999824
Case783,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"In the same way as the reasons of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal are not to be approached ""minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error"", neither are the reasons of the Minister: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. 24 Even adopting that approach, I am of the opinion that the Minister misconstrued Direction No 21. The Minister referred to ""the information relevant to this consideration"" and the only information to which that could have referred is the statement that the applicant has no children. That is the information the Minister said weighed in favour of cancelling the applicant's visa and to which he said he gave (as a consideration) considerable weight. In my opinion, that is a misconstruction of Direction No 21 because once the decision-maker finds that a non-citizen has no children, the matter or consideration became irrelevant. I do not think it is possible to construe the Minister's reasons as saying no more than that the matter of the best interests of the child was irrelevant and, as this was generally a matter in favour of not cancelling the visa, the other matters in favour of cancellation were not counter-balanced by this consideration.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.093,0.063,0.845,0.6588,5.2788
Case784,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Re; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1","The rules of procedural fairness apply to the exercise of the power in s 501(2) of the Act: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ("" Lam ""). 31 The applicant submits that the matter the Minister took into account the fact that the applicant did not have children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa stood outside the terms of Direction No 21. The applicant submits that he was not given the opportunity to comment upon whether that was a matter the Minister should take into account. The applicant submits that there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and he put two alternative submissions. 32 First, he submits that he was led to believe that the Minister would make his decision by reference to the matters in Direction No 21 and only by reference to those matters. That submission requires an examination of the two letters sent to the applicant inviting him to make submissions in support of his contention that his visa should not be cancelled. In the letter from the Department dated 7 August 2006 the following passage appears: "" Should your visa be cancelled? If the Minister or a delegate makes a determination that he or she reasonably suspects that you do not pass the character test, and you fail to satisfy him or her that you do pass the character test, the Minister or the delegate will then consider whether your visa should be cancelled. Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by a delegate In considering whether to exercise the power under s 501(2) to cancel your visa, a delegate will be required to follow directions given by the Minister under s 499 of the Migration Act . Those directions are contained in Direction No 21 ('Direction under Section 499 Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section 501 Migration Act 1958 '). I have attached a copy of Direction No 21 for your information. Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by the Minister If the decision in relation to cancellation of your visa is made by the Minister, although she may decide to have regard to the matters discussed in Minister's Direction No 21, she is not required to give consideration to those matters. Your opportunity to comment Before the Minister or delegate considers whether to cancel your visa under s 501(2) , you are provided with an opportunity to comment. You may provide information and comments in relation to: &#61863; whether you fail the character test; and &#61863; whether your visa should be cancelled. In making a decision whether to cancel your visa under s 501(2) , the Minister or delegate will take the following information into account already available to the Department: &#61863; Offender History Report (Attachment A) &#61863; Certificate of Record for the sentence of 02/07/2003 (Attachment B) &#61863; Judge's sentencing remarks of 02/07/2003 (Attachment C) &#61863; Report by Community Corrections Officer dated 21/06/2006 (Attachment D) The Department has also obtained reports from the Parole Board of SA. These reports have been classified as 'non-disclosable information' pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Act and can not [sic] be released to you, however you are invited to comment. If there is any additional information that you wish the Minister or delegate to consider, you must give that information to the Department. If you do not provide any further information the Minister or a delegate may rely upon the information set out above to determine that your visa are [sic] are liable to cancellation under s 501(2) of the Migration Act . In preparing your comments, please read fully and carefully the contents of the Minister's Direction. You should address each and every topic that you feel applies to you or is relevant to your circumstances. You may also provide any further information, apart from those considerations found in the Minister's Direction, that you feel the Minister or delegate ought to be aware of and take into account."" 36 In my opinion, there are two answers to that submission. First, I am not satisfied that it can be inferred that the correspondence from the Department would have led to the belief (based on reasonable grounds) that the topic of children and the best interests of children would only be dealt with in the manner contemplated by Direction No 21 and not otherwise. In this case it is a matter of looking at what may be reasonably inferred from the letters sent by the Department and other circumstances. It was not contended that the applicant's actual belief is relevant; in any event there was no evidence of his belief. It seems to me that the significance to the decision of having a family including children in Australia or not having a family for a person facing the cancellation of their visa would be obvious. Furthermore, I note that although it appears under the heading of ""Other considerations"" in Direction No 21, the Direction identifies ""family composition of the non-citizen's family, both in Australia and overseas"" as a relevant consideration: cl 2.17(d). Secondly, I do not think it can be said that any practical injustice has been shown: Lam at 14 [38] per Gleeson CJ, at 34-35 [106] per McHugh and Gummow JJ. I realise that the Court must be careful not to engage in a determination of the merits of a decision under the guise of considering an argument as to futility. However, in this case I do not think there was any practical injustice to the applicant. In practical terms he was afforded a full opportunity to be heard on the matters ultimately taken into account by the Minister. 37 In my opinion, the application must be dismissed. I will hear the parties on costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

Case785,Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Limited (1989) 20 FCR 403,"In any event, the recipient of a notice would have an obligation to claim privilege over documents in the possession of the recipient that the recipient reasonably believed were subject to the privilege of someone else, such as a client of the recipient. The recipient would have an obligation to preserve legal professional privilege by reason of the character or status of the documents as being privileged. The privilege attaches to a document and, once privileged, the document will always be privileged. As the possessor or custodian of a document that has such a special character or status, the recipient of a notice requiring production of such a document would have an obligation to take steps to preserve and maintain that character or status. The recipient of a notice would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost (see Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Limited (1989) 20 FCR 403 at 414). 35 A governmental authority issuing a compulsory production notice, in whatever form, must provide the recipient of the notice with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege, both on its own behalf and on behalf of others. The recipient must not be denied the opportunity to make adequate claims for privilege in relation to the documents of itself or its clients that are the subject of the compulsory production notice (see Citibank at 414). 36 However, there is no requirement for such an authority to give clients of the recipient, as distinct from the recipient, a reasonable opportunity to make claims for privilege before enforcing the compulsory production notice. The most that is required is that the recipient of such a notice must be afforded the opportunity of asserting legal professional privilege, either on the recipient's account or on account of another person, such as a client. It has not been suggested that any recipient of a notice in issue in the present proceeding was not given an opportunity to obtain legal advice or that any claim for privilege made by a recipient, on behalf of the recipient or a third party, was not respected.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.18,0.021,0.799,0.9951,6.32385
Case786,May v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152,"There is no requirement that a person other than a recipient be afforded the opportunity to claim or assert legal professional privilege and the scheme of the Act makes it clear that no such right is to be afforded to a person in the position of the applicants. There is no requirement for the Commission either to notify persons in the position of the applicants that a notice has been issued to a third party that may require the production of documents that are subject to a privilege of the applicants. Nor is there any requirement for a person in the position of the applicant to be notified by the Commission, after production of documents by a recipient of a notice, of the fact of the production of documents that may be the subject of a claim for privilege on behalf of an applicant that was not made by the recipient of the notice. There is no requirement, for example, that an authority issuing a compulsory production notice to a solicitor should notify the solicitor's clients that the solicitor has been given such a notice in order that the client might have the opportunity to challenge the validity of the notice on grounds of privilege (see May v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 at [36] , [31] and [38]. 38 Further, the regime contemplated by s 29A(4) , under which a notation will be cancelled in specified circumstances, would be effective to ensure that, even if the privilege had not been claimed previously, it could be claimed as soon as a criminal proceeding is begun. Thus, the holder of the privilege would be able to make the claim for privilege prior to the tendering in evidence against that person of any document obtained by the Commission pursuant to a notice containing a relevant notation. The right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her would therefore be protected. 39 Section 29B evinces a clear intention on the part of the Parliament that, in relation to documents produced by third parties who are not lawyers, the existence of the notice pursuant to which it is produced is not to be disclosed even to a potential holder or privilege, for so long as the notation is operational. The Act does not take away or abrogate legal professional privilege. It simply has the effect that, in particular circumstances, the holder of the privilege may not know that documents that might be the subject of the privilege are the subject of a notice requiring production by the possessor or custodian of the documents.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.126,0.034,0.84,0.9894,6.370900000000001
Case787,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24,"An administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account, that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the [1986] HCA 40 ; Act ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40). 41 In the present case, s 29A(2) sets out factors that an Examiner must consider when determining whether a notation must or may be included in a notice. The matters that must be taken into consideration are: &#8226; the safety or reputation of a person; &#8226; the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence; &#8226; the effectiveness of an operation or investigation. 42 Further, the scheme of ss 29A and 29B recognises the existence of legal professional privilege in so far as the prohibition on disclosure does not prevent a person from making disclosure to a legal practitioner or, if the person is a legal practitioner, for the purpose of obtaining instructions as to the production of a document. 43 Under s 30(3) a legal practitioner may refuse to comply with a requirement to produce a document containing a privileged communication unless the person with whom the communication was made agrees to the practitioner complying with the requirement. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act make it abundantly clear that an Examiner who is deciding whether or not to issue a notice and whether to include a notation in the notice is not required to have regard to the possibility that the recipient of the notice may not discharge that recipient's obligation to assert or claim legal professional privilege that may reside in a person other than the recipient in relation to the document that the recipient is required to produce. 44 That is the clear intent and purpose of ss 29A and 29B. However, the clear object of ss 29A and 29B is to ensure that, in some circumstances, the object of an investigation, such as persons in the position of the applicants, is not informed of the existence of a notice. The relevant Examiners did not fail to take into account a consideration that they were bound to take into account simply by reason of the fact that they did not have regard to the possibility that documents that were required to be produced by a notice might be the subject of legal professional privilege of a person other than the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.121,0.031,0.847,0.9898,6.3713
Case788,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539,"22 May 2009, for reasons which I then gave, I granted certain interlocutory injunctive relief on the application of the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) - Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539. These reasons should be read in conjunction with those of 22 May 2009. The interlocutory relief granted on 22 May 2009 was not as extensive as the ACMA had sought, but that was because of comprehensive undertakings which were then proffered to the Court.

Mr Salcedo also makes reference to negotiations having occurred with the ACMA in relation to the proceedings and attaches, without the permission of the AGS, a copy of a ""without prejudice"" letter written by the AGS in that regard. That attachment should not have occurred. The ACMA, by the AGS, does not object to the marking of the letter as an exhibit but with the proviso that the attachment should not be available for general searching. That seems to me the appropriate course to take in respect of it. I shall give directions accordingly.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.139,0.048,0.813,0.9756,6.323600000000001
Case790,Humphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd (ACN 104 808 853) [2008] FCA 569 ; (2008) 76 IPR 144,"the Court is alternatively empowered to give judgment or make any other order against the respondent concerned. In other words, there is no requirement that evidence be adduced by the parties seeking default judgment in respect of the matters pleaded in the statement of claim. Instead, the statement of claim must be scrutinised to see whether it discloses a cause of action in law in respect of the relief sought. In Humphreys v Halifax Vogel Group Pty Ltd (ACN 104 808 853) (2008) IPR 144 at 146, [6] to [9], I concluded that this was the effect of the rule.

Case791,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665,"is not to say that the receipt of evidence is precluded on an application for default judgment under O 35A. Prior authority establishes that additional evidence consistent with a party's case as pleaded in the statement of claim may be considered with respect to the relief sought: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 (Kiefel J (affirmed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 161 FCR 513) (Dataline). In Dataline , Kiefel J also noted of O 35A that: The statement of claim alleges numerous contraventions of s 16(1) and s 16(9) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act). It further alleges contraventions by the First and Second Respondents of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) with the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents being alleged to be parties to these corporate contraventions. Albeit at the risk of over-generalisation, the conduct alleged may be summarised as the deceptive use of fabricated profiles on dating websites in order to obtain mobile telephone numbers for the purpose of sending or causing to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages to the unsuspecting telephone account holders. Yet, further conduct alleged involves the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages which purport to supply a ""single club"" or ""fantasy chat"" service to unsuspecting telephone account holders. So far as the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents are concerned, I am satisfied that the statement of claim alleges contraventions known to law of the Spam Act and the Trade Practices Act and which enliven the Court's jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief. I am further satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is not merely a bland recitation of statutory prohibitions but rather has been framed with sufficient precision to enable the Respondents concerned to identify the conduct which is the subject of restraint and so as to permit ready identification of an event of default. The declarations sought are in these terms: Declarations concerning contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) A declaration that the first respondent, whose central management and control was in Australia, by sending short message service (""SMS"") messages or causing SMS messages to be sent via 19773366 and 19910006 to Australian mobile telephone numbers, which it had obtained by deception using fabricated dating website profiles, for the purpose of dishonestly obtaining the account holders' acceptance of its Safe Divert service, has engaged in conduct in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) .

Declarations concerning contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) A declaration that each of the first and second respondents, in trade or commerce: 11.1 by the use of dating website profiles created and registered on dating websites, represented to dating website members that the individuals described in those profiles were members of the respective dating website; and further, 11.2 by communicating with dating websites as those profiles, represented to dating website members that the communication was with the individuals described in those profiles; when in fact: 11.3 the individuals described in the profiles did not exist; 11.4 it did not inform the dating website members that it had created the profiles; 11.5 it did not inform the dating website members that their mobile telephone numbers were being obtained for the purpose of collecting mobile telephone numbers of Australian mobile telephone account holders to be recipients of commercial electronic messages via 19773366, 19910006 and/or 19724253; and 11.6 any communication between dating website members and the profiles was between it and those members; engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive contrary to s.52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).

To take just one example, s 1317P is directly contrary to that submission. Moreover, the decision of Fryberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 276 does not support that submission.

Case794,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373,"The statutory duties imposed by ss 180 , 181 and 182 of the Corporations Act reflect and, to some extent, refine the obligations of the directors at general law: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373 at [99]. Each is a duty owed by a director to the corporation. However, directors' duties provisions are not concerned with any general obligation owed by directors to conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with the law generally or the Corporations Act . Moreover, the directors' duties provisions do not necessarily make a director liable for a breach by the company of another provision in the Corporations Act . The corollary is that it cannot be said that every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions. 23 That last proposition or principle (that not every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions) is self evident. It is reinforced by the fact that, under s 180(1) of the Corporations Act , the circumstances of the particular company are relevant to the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence. The circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the type of company, the size and nature of the company's business, the director's position and responsibilities within the company, the particular functions the director is performing, the manner in which responsibility for the business of the company is distributed and, of course, the circumstances of the case: Maxwell at [100] and the authorities referred to. 24 The need to consider the circumstances of a particular company in defining the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence is demonstrated in the case of Mr Pritchard. The circumstances of Warrenmang are outlined in paras [5] to [15] above. There was an "" identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders, so that in effect the directors [were] the shareholders "": Maxwell [103]. Ordinarily that fact may make the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing much less acute: Maxwell at [103]. In the case of Warrenmang, the identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders in fact meant the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing was acute because of the following circumstances. (1) Warrenmang was registered as an unlisted public company on 1 September 2003 with Mr Pritchard holding approximately 20 million of the 20.82 issued shares; (2) although at the time of its incorporation, three directors were appointed, Mr Pritchard was at all times the person in charge of Warrenmang's day to day activities including maintenance of its financial records and was its controlling mind; (3) on 5 December 2003 and again 10 March 2004, Warrenmang sought to raise funds from the public through the sale shares in Warrenmang and in response to the IPO and the Supplementary Prospectus did in fact raise substantial funds from hundreds of subscribers; and (4) the subscription monies were received by Warrenmang and deposited into the Warrenmang Accounts to which Mr Pritchard was the sole signatory.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.052,0.007,0.942,0.9702,6.3537

Case798,Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672,"ASIC may apply for such a declaration: s 1317J. Section 1317E(2) prescribes what a declaration under s 1317E(1) must specify, namely: ""(a) the Court that made the declaration; (b) the civil penalty provision that was contravened; (c) the person who contravened the provision; (d) the conduct that constituted the contravention; (e) if the contravention is of a corporation / scheme civil penalty provision the corporation or registered scheme to which the conduct related."" Section 1317F provides that a declaration of contravention is conclusive evidence of the matters referred to in s 1317E(2): Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672. As a result, the court must specify the conduct that constituted the contravention with sufficient particularity to enable the declaration of contravention not only to stand on its own but to meet the statutory requirements and purpose of s 1317E. 33 Other sections provide for the making of pecuniary penalty orders (s 1317G) and provide that the Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters (s 1317L). 34 The intersection between the civil and criminal process is addressed in ss 1317M , 1317N and 1317P . The intersection is not easy. In the present case, it is further complicated by the timing of ASIC's application for declaration of contravention. Section 1317M deals with civil proceedings after criminal proceedings and provides that: ""A court must not make a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention ."" (Emphasis Added) 35 Section 1317N deals with criminal proceedings during civil proceedings and provides: ""(1) Proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order against a person are stayed if: (a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. (2) The proceedings for the declaration or order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the declaration or order are dismissed."" This provision is significant. It provides that proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order are stayed if criminal proceedings are on foot at the same time in relation to conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. In this provision, no distinction is drawn between proceedings for a declaration of contravention and proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order. 36 Section 1317P then deals with criminal proceedings after civil proceedings. It provides: ""(1) Subject to subsection (2), criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether: (a) a declaration of contravention has been made against the person; or (b) a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person; or (c) a compensation order has been made against the person; or (d) the person has been disqualified from managing a corporation under Part 2D.6 ; or (e) an order has been made against the person by ASIC under section 920A (banning orders) or by the Court under section 921A (disqualification by Court).""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.013,0.135,0.852,-0.9978,-0.3703000000000003

Further, the issues of which proof is required under each provision differs in that s 84C applies where an application does not comply with ss 61 , 61A or 62 whereas O 20 r 2 is only enlivened if no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or the proceeding is an abuse of process.

In the present application the persons who compromise the Native Title Claim Group are not identified either by name or by reference or by any sufficient description. There is also a lack of evidence that the Native Title Claim Group, which is alleged to have authorised Mr Booth, had any applicable traditional decision-making process or that any particular process was followed. There is no evidence that the Native Title Claim Group agreed to and adopted some other decision-making process in relation to authorising the applicant to make the application. Nor is there any evidence that the process has been recognised or that any process has been followed. 35 These comments are equally applicable in the case before me. Other than an assertion by the applicant that the late Oodgeroo, the late Kath Walker, has authorised the applicant to make the application, and that such authorisation is through ""Traditional Custom and Lore"", there is no evidence that the applicant is authorised by the claim group, even to the extent that the claim group in this case can be identified. No details of the decisions that the claim group made are provided.

Case811,Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178,"Notwithstanding these distinctions, the Courts have tended to equate the consequences of strike-out under s 84C with those of summary dismissal under O 20 r 2. As observed by Lander J (North and Dowsett JJ agreeing) in Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178: [48] Section 84C only applies to applications which do not comply with ss 61 , 61A and 62 . However, an application under s 84C, if successful, has the very serious consequence that the native title application is struck out. Such a result is akin to a court proceeding being summarily dismissed, or at least dismissed before any hearing on the merits. No court proceeding is summarily dismissed except in a very clear case: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129. [49] Applications for native title are brought by representatives of the native title claim group. The dismissal of an application because, for example, the applicant has not been authorised means the dismissal of the native title claim group's claim. The repercussions, therefore, are far reaching. I see no reason why an application to strike out a native title claim under s 84C should be treated any differently to any other application to dismiss a claim summarily. The power should be exercised sparingly and with caution, and only when the Court is satisfied that the moving party has made out a clear case that the applicant has not complied with the relevant section and cannot, by amending the application, comply. Section 84C assumes that a party might respond to a strike out application by amending the claim to comply with the requirements of the Act. A claim can be amended without obtaining leave. 18 The cautious approach of the Court as described in Williams [2004] FCAFC 178 was more recently reaffirmed by the Full Court in Bodney 140 FCR at 89, where Stone J (with whom Spender and Branson JJ agreed on this point) said that notwithstanding the operation of s 84C in the context of native title applications, the Court approaches strike-out applications under this section in the same way as applications under O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules (see also Landers v State of South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at 497, Thomas v State of South Australia [2004] FCA 951 at [2] - [3] , McKenzie v State Government of South Australia (2005) 214 ALR 214 at 221).",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.078,0.027,0.895,0.9726,6.3531
Case812,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190,"Observations concerning the meaning of effect of s 424A were made by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , at 1195 1196, [15] [17]. In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, one there finds the following in para 15: Section 424A does not require notice to be given of every matter the Tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review. Rather the Tribunal's obligation is limited to the written provision of ""particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review"". 9 And then in para 17: The ""reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that is under review"" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellant's statutory declaration would itself be ""information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason for, affirming the decision that is under review"". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellant's claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations. 10 Appended to the protection visa application was a statement of the male Appellant. That statement provided the basis upon which a claim for a protection visa was made. It also provided, for the reason which I have already given, the basis upon which the Appellant's wife advanced her claim. The basis of the claim for a protection visa, as there made, was not enlarged upon in the proceedings of the Tribunal. That is because, though invited to attend at a hearing and present evidence, the Appellant and his wife did not take advantage of that opportunity. The Tribunal, then, as it was entitled to do under the Migration Act 1958 , decided the case on the basis of the material which it did have, and that material, in essence, was the statement to which I have referred.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.021,0.032,0.947,-0.6298,0.8066999999999998

Case814,Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469,"In Zhan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 327 ; (2003) 128 FCR 469 ( Zhan ), Allsop J had to deal with an alleged failure of a written notice to comply with s 66(2) of the Act. That provision related to notification of a decision to refuse an application for a visa. In the circumstances, the notification was required to state where an application for review of the decision could be made (subpara 66(2)(d)(iv) of the Act). His Honour said (at [64]) that the purpose of such a statement was to give information as to where the applicant could ""make the application"", that is, ""initiate it"". His Honour's statement is consistent with my holding above. 28 In Zhan , the applicant was told that lodgement of documents had to be at ""a registry of the Tribunal"" and no address was given. A leaflet giving that information was not included with the letter. His Honour left open the possibility that identification of ""registries"" of the Tribunal in the telephone directory might have sufficed to supply the meaning of the expression ""a registry of the Tribunal"", but the fact was that the telephone directory did not specify that the address given in it was that of a ""registry"". Allsop J remarked (at [65]) that the address given in the telephone directory might have been the Tribunal's head office or the site of some other activity of the Tribunal. 29 The word ""registry"" assumed a special significance in Zhan because of its appearance in the letter a feature that is absent from the present case. In this respect Zhan is distinguishable. 30 Counsel for the Minister submits, correctly, that the facts of the present case are different from those in Zhan because the written notice in the present case did state ""the Tribunal at GPO Box 9955"". However, as noted earlier, the Minister correctly concedes that an application would not be received by the Tribunal and therefore would not be made to the Tribunal when it reached that address. If an applicant led evidence to support an inference that an application reached the nominated post office box, it would nonetheless be open to the Minister to defeat the application by proving that the application was not in fact received in the registry office of the Tribunal. 31 In Chan Ta Srey v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1292 , Gray J, after referring to Zhan , held (at [53]) that where any of the requirements of s 66(2) of the Act were not complied with, there was no ""notification"" with the result that time did not begin to run in respect of an application to the Migration Review Tribunal.

Case815,"Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Wooley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278","Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts.

The fact that one particular expert of the highest authority and of unimpeachable credit is permitted to swear to an opinion on similarity or dissimilarity does not relieve the court of the responsibility of forming its own opinion on this issue. In this sense the expert evidence in a suit such as the present fills a somewhat unusual role. It is almost as if each side calls an expert to argue out with counsel in examination-in-chief and cross-examination the similarity or dissimilarity which that particular expert sees between the plans and houses. By attending to the progress of this argumentative process between counsel and expert the court is enabled to perceive and more readily to appreciate the points of similarity and dissimilarity. In this way the tendering of expert evidence is of value in exposing the facets of the ultimate question to which the expert opinion evidence is directed. But the important point is that, in distinction from the judicial process in relation to expert evidence such as is normally encountered in litigation, a court in the present type of litigation is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to form and act on its own original opinion.

Case817,Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67,"Cadbury submitted that if Darrell Lea wished to challenge or qualify the conclusions reached by the witness on the basis of different factual assumptions the Rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 required the cross-examiner to ask the witness whether such matters resulted in any change to his opinion. 40 As well as Browne v Dunn itself, Cadbury cited in support of this proposition the decision of the Full Court in Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549. That case concerned an appeal from a jury's conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of his second wife and murder of her lover. Evidence was given by a Mr Saulwick of a survey of persons in the Australian Capital Territory as to their knowledge of the appellant's conviction five years earlier of the manslaughter of his first wife and the effect any such knowledge would have on their opinion as to his likely guilt of a similar offence in relation to the second wife. This evidence was adduced in support of an application for leave to challenge jurors as to cause. There was discussion at 557 by Drummond J (with whom Davies and Miles JJ agreed) critical of the usefulness of the survey. In substance his Honour found it was not useful and not a sufficient basis for its conclusion that at least one member of the jury would have connected the appellant with the 1987 killing and, for that reason, would have found the appellant guilty of the 1992 offences. Davies J at 551-552 also gave reasons for his conclusion that the survey questions were ""misconceived"". Mr Saulwick was cross-examined. It may be that some matters relied on by their Honours were not put to him. For example, in making the point that the sample was drawn from ACT voters and not the more limited population of the ACT eligible for jury service Drummond J said at 557: ""This may or may not affect Mr Saulwick's opinion"". If anything, the case seems contrary to Cadbury's argument. In any event, Browne v Dunn is not mentioned. 41 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15: The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn. See also Dolan v Australian &amp; Overseas Telecommunications Corp [1993] FCA 202 ; (1993) 42 FCR 206 at 207 8; [1993] FCA 202 ; 114 ALR 231 ; Marelic v Comcare [1993] FCA 599 ; (1993) 121 ALR 114 at 119 20. It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued: The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted. 42 Likewise in Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 236 Mahoney JA said: ...failure to cross-examine a witness may not found such an assumption or render the course of the trial unfair if it is clear from the manner in which generally the case has been conducted that his evidence will be contested. This was pointed out by Lord Herschell ([in Browne v Dunn] at 71). The nature of the defendant's case and the particulars given, and otherwise the conduct of it may make it sufficiently clear that such an assumption is unwarranted and that there has been no surprise or prejudice concerning the matter. 43 As to the application of Browne v Dunn in modern commercial litigation, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR (Digest) |P 46-183 at 50,323, approved on appeal: J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532 at [103] - [107] . 51 Thus, quite apart from Darrell Lea's criticisms, the Court is entitled, and indeed bound, to form its own views on the evidence, including, but by no means limited to, the opinions of the Cadbury experts. It was put that by choosing not to adduce any expert evidence, Darrell Lea ""effectively accepts the (Cadbury) expert evidence"" and that in accordance with Browne v Dunn ""Darrell Lea is now estopped from making any submissions that the expert evidence is incorrect"".

By attending to the progress of this argumentative process between counsel and expert the court is enabled to perceive and more readily to appreciate the points of similarity and dissimilarity. In this way the tendering of expert evidence is of value in exposing the facets of the ultimate question to which the expert opinion evidence is directed. But the important point is that, in distinction from the judicial process in relation to expert evidence such as is normally encountered in litigation, a court in the present type of litigation is entitled, and, indeed, bound, to form and act on its own original opinion. His Honour's approach would seem to apply a fortiori in a case concerning the retail marketing of everyday consumer products.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.068,0.051,0.882,0.8819,6.07265
Case818,Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549,"As well as Browne v Dunn itself, Cadbury cited in support of this proposition the decision of the Full Court in Bush v The Queen [1993] FCA 361 ; (1993) 43 FCR 549. That case concerned an appeal from a jury's conviction of the appellant for attempted murder of his second wife and murder of her lover. Evidence was given by a Mr Saulwick of a survey of persons in the Australian Capital Territory as to their knowledge of the appellant's conviction five years earlier of the manslaughter of his first wife and the effect any such knowledge would have on their opinion as to his likely guilt of a similar offence in relation to the second wife. This evidence was adduced in support of an application for leave to challenge jurors as to cause. There was discussion at 557 by Drummond J (with whom Davies and Miles JJ agreed) critical of the usefulness of the survey. In substance his Honour found it was not useful and not a sufficient basis for its conclusion that at least one member of the jury would have connected the appellant with the 1987 killing and, for that reason, would have found the appellant guilty of the 1992 offences. Davies J at 551-552 also gave reasons for his conclusion that the survey questions were ""misconceived"". Mr Saulwick was cross-examined. It may be that some matters relied on by their Honours were not put to him. For example, in making the point that the sample was drawn from ACT voters and not the more limited population of the ACT eligible for jury service Drummond J said at 557: ""This may or may not affect Mr Saulwick's opinion"". If anything, the case seems contrary to Cadbury's argument. In any event, Browne v Dunn is not mentioned.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.087,0.094,0.819,-0.6358,0.7816999999999994

Case820,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119,"After hearing further argument the Full Court made orders in relation to costs of the appeal: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 ( Full Court III ). The Full Court ordered that Darrell Lea pay Cadbury's costs other than its costs of and associated with grounds 1-14 inclusive, 17 and 18 of the amended notice of appeal, and that Cadbury pay Darrell Lea's costs of and associated with those grounds. 7 Their Honours in Full Court III noted at [8] that at the hearing of the appeal some grounds of the amended notice of appeal were abandoned by Cadbury, namely grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18, and that grounds 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which raised challenges to substantive findings of the trial judge, were pressed only formally at the hearing of the appeal and were rejected by the Court. 8 On the further hearing Cadbury called its three experts and they were cross-examined by senior counsel for Darrell Lea. Darrell Lea had filed an affidavit by an expert in the same area, a Mr Hall, but did not read his affidavit. 9 Against that background, an initial question has been raised as to the findings made in the earlier judgment under the heading Summary of Findings at [95] to [112] as follows (I have added cross-references indicating grounds in Cadbury's amended notice of appeal which challenge the finding or seek a different finding on the same topic): 95 The evidence warrants the following findings. 96 There is wide awareness amongst Australian consumers of the use by Cadbury of a dark purple colour (i) in connection with the marketing, packaging and presentation of certain chocolate products particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk and other block milk chocolate products, and (ii) as a corporate colour. [Grounds 1, 2] 97 Cadbury does not have an exclusive reputation in the use of this dark purple colour in connection with chocolate. Other traders have, with Cadbury's knowledge, for many years used a similar shade of purple. Cadbury has not consistently enforced its alleged exclusive reputation. In relation to its chief competitor Nestl&eacute;, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products. [Grounds 1, 2] 98 Cadbury markets many chocolate products which have little or no purple in their packaging. 99 Cadbury products, regardless of the presence or absence of purple in the packaging, always bear the Cadbury name in a distinctive script. [Ground 2] 100 Cadbury's use of purple in marketing advertising and promotion is, and is seen by consumers to be, inextricably bound up with the well known name Cadbury in its distinctive script. Cadbury never uses the colour purple in isolation as an indicium of trade. [Ground 2] 101 Cadbury products, with insignificant exceptions, are not sold at retail level at premises owned or occupied by Cadbury. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 102 Cadbury's marketing of chocolate heavily emphasises specific products and in particular Cadbury Dairy Milk block chocolate. [Ground 8] 103 Darrell Lea is a name well known in connection with chocolate in those parts of Australia where it operates, even though not as well known as Cadbury. [Ground 10] 104 The names Darrell Lea and Cadbury are quite distinct in sound and appearance (especially with the respective scripts the parties have adopted) and not likely to be mistaken for each other. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury. There has been particular use at Christmas 2000 to 2004 inclusive and also uses at other times. Such usage has diminished and purple has been to a significant extent replaced by blue since 2004. [Ground 12] 106 Darrell Lea did not adopt the colour purple with the intention of leading consumers to believe its products were Cadbury products or that it, or its products, had some kind of association with Cadbury. [Grounds 3, 4, 5] 107 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in premises which it owns or occupies. Other retailing occurs from separate stands or displays in retail premises, such as newsagents, pharmacies, convenience stores and video stores. Darrell Lea has only a minor presence in supermarkets and only, in the past, to a very limited and transient extent in the major chains. Its products are not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's. [Grounds 6, 7, 8] 108 Darrell Lea's marketing gives less emphasis to particular products than does Cadbury. [Grounds 8, 10, 11, 12] 109 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 110 Darrell Lea uses its name in a distinctive script widely and consistently in marketing, packaging and point of sale presentation. [Grounds 10, 11, 12] 111 Colour recognition or attraction can play an important part in consumer decisions to purchase chocolate. [Ground 9] 112 Consumer decisions to purchase chocolate are often made quickly and on impulse but not necessarily irrationally. Price and brand recognition can play an important part. [Ground 9] 10 After analysing Cadbury's case I reached the following conclusions (again, references to the grounds in the amended notice of appeal are inserted): 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. [Grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] They have distinct identities in the market place. [Grounds 11, 12] Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.039,0.91,0.9281,6.2383500000000005
Case821,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102,"Cadbury brought a motion to the Full Court seeking an order that the previous order remitting the matter to the trial judge for further hearing be varied to provide that the matter be remitted to the trial judge for a new trial: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102 ( Full Court II ). In rejecting Cadbury's motion the Full Court said: 4 We do not understand Cadbury to be suggesting that an order remitting the matter to the primary judge for a further hearing was not open to the Court. Cadbury's motion appears to have been prompted by a directions hearing before the primary judge on 12 June 2007 during which his Honour indicated his understanding that the effect of the Full Court's order was that there would be a further hearing at which the excluded evidence would be adduced, but that that would be the extent of the further hearing. It would seem that that was not Cadbury's understanding of the effect of the Full Court's order of 21 May 2007. 5 It is clear that Cadbury sought a new trial as part of the relief claimed in the appeal. On the hearing of the appeal, one of the issues was whether, even if there had been an error on the part of the primary judge in excluding evidence there was nevertheless no miscarriage of justice and the orders made by the primary judge should therefore stand. The Full Court rejected that contention. The Court concluded that it could not be said that the disputed evidence was of so little weight that it could not influence the result of a new trial, so as to produce a different result (at [111]). 6 However, the Court did not consider that a new trial was justified. Rather, the Court was of the view that justice would be served by a further hearing before the primary judge, at which Cadbury would have another opportunity of adducing the disputed evidence. 7 The proceeding was remitted on the basis that it would be before the primary judge as though the case were part heard. Thus, it would be a matter for the primary judge to determine the extent to which, after entertaining all proper objections and making rulings on such objections, additional or further evidence should be admitted. That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence. 8 We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections. That would be an aspect of the management of the further hearing by the primary judge in the same way as it would have been had his Honour not rejected the disputed evidence in its entirety. That is to say, it would be for counsel for Darrell Lea to make such objections to the admissibility of the disputed evidence on formal grounds as they may consider appropriate. If, in the exercise of his discretion, the primary judge were to permit Cadbury the opportunity of adducing further evidence to overcome any objections, that would be a matter entirely for his Honour at the further hearing. 9 It is conceivable that, after hearing proper objections from Darrell Lea, none of the disputed evidence will be admitted. We do not, by that comment, indicate any view about the outcome of any objections one way or the other, except to the extent that we indicated the principles to be applied in our reasons of 21 May 2007. It is, of course, conceivable, and we make no comment one way or the other as to whether it is likely, that is Honour would still reject the disputed evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act . That is entirely a matter for the primary judge. 10 Further, there would be no reason why the primary judge should entertain any contention that he should reverse earlier rulings made by him that were not in any way dependant upon the rejection of the disputed evidence. His Honour should be in a position to conduct the further hearing as though he had admitted such of the disputed evidence as his Honour finds to be admissible after considering appropriate objections. 11 In so far as we referred to ""a further trial"" (at [129]) or ""the new trial judge"" (at [130]) we should be understood as having referred to a further hearing by the primary judge along those lines. As we said (at [114]): In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing. Of course, if the primary judge were prepared to entertain a submission that he would not be able to bring an open mind to the resolution of the proceeding in the light of his Honour's earlier rulings both on the disputed evidence and in the final decision, it would be a matter for his Honour to decide whether he considered it was appropriate for the proceeding to be referred to another judge for a retrial ab initio. 12 Similarly, if the primary judge were persuaded that the conduct of the hearing to date was such that the admission of any part of the disputed evidence that his Honour was disposed to admit would cause injustice, it would be a matter for his Honour as to whether the trial should, for that reason, be aborted. The primary judge should be regarded as being in the same position as he would have been in had he not made the ruling of 31 March 2006. It is clear from the context that the term ""rulings"" in [10] is a reference to rulings on evidence and procedure and not substantive findings, as to which see [11]-[12] below.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.101,0.064,0.835,0.9898,6.427300000000001

Case825,Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133,"Nevertheless s 80 of the Evidence Act deals only with the admissibility of evidence. It does not affect the approach to particular kinds of evidence in particular categories of cases. In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] in the context of a s 52 and passing off case (and well after the introduction of the Evidence Act ), Branson J, after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection, said: However, I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case, which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public, I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance. This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts. It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way. I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely 'impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight.

His Lordship said (at 738; 515): [W]here goods are sold to the general public for consumption or domestic use, the question whether such buyers would be likely to be deceived or confused by the use of the trademark is a 'jury question'. By that I mean: that if the issue had now, as formerly, to be tried by a jury, who as members of the general public would themselves be potential buyers of the goods, they would be required not only to consider any evidence of other members of the public which had been adduced but also to use their own common sense and to consider whether they would themselves be likely to be deceived or confused. The question does not cease to be a 'jury question' when the issue is tried by a judge alone or on appeal by a plurality of judges. The judge's approach to the question should be the same as that of a jury. He, too, would be a potential buyer of the goods. He should, of course, be alert to the danger of allowing his own idiosyncratic knowledge or temperament to influence his decision, but the whole of his training in the practice of the law should have accustomed him to this, and this should provide the safety which in the case of a jury is provided by their number. That in issues of this kind judges are entitled to give effect to their own opinions as to the likelihood of deception or confusion and, in doing so, are not confined to the evidence of witnesses called at the trial is well established by the decisions of this House itself. 87 In its written submissions Cadbury cited numerous decisions which were said to involve facts or issues similar to the present case and statements of judges about the facts in those cases.

Case830,Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298,"Cadbury submitted that the failure of Darrell Lea to adduce evidence (expert or lay) as to the effect that third party use of purple has adversely impacted Cadbury's reputation in Cadbury purple meant that the Court ought to draw a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference that any evidence it might have sought to adduce would not have assisted its case in this respect. I do not agree. There was substantial evidence of the fact of third party usage given by Darrell Lea's Mr Michael Lea (earlier judgment [52]-[54]) and evidence of Cadbury's ""Co-existence Agreement"" with Nestl&eacute; under which Cadbury agreed not to object to Nestl&eacute;'s use of get-ups for Violet Crumble (a chocolate-coated honeycomb bar which might be said to verge on the iconic), Wonka, Quality Street and Polly Waffle, all of which featured purple ([55]-[56]). For its part Cadbury adduced evidence of its efforts to restrain third party usage, which met with mixed success ([57]-[67]). There was evidence of actual third party usage in the present case sufficient for the Court to make its own findings. 59 Mr Riches said that the third party products ""did not come close to dominating the chocolate confectionery market in the same way as Cadbury Dairy Milk"" and that no other brand consistently used purple as a ""brand identity element"" in promotional campaigns. Dr Stavros thought that purple used with Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble were ""product specific instances of the use of a colour, rather than a corporate or master branding or mega branding"". However, the lack of specialised knowledge of the confectionery market of these witnesses has already been noted. 60 Dr Stavros said that some consumers would pick up a Violet Crumble, see the Nestl&eacute; brand and ""make the connection between those brands [ie Nestl&eacute; and Cadbury] and be aware that there's a distinction between those organisations"". He continued: There's a scope though for other consumers to see the purple, relate that to the Cadbury brand and either believe that the product comes from Cadbury, or that there is some association between those organisations, I think that's possible it's very possible.

Case833,Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1,"In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 145 ALR 1 Tamberlin J discussed the application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn in the context of a copyright infringement case where one issue was whether a Mr Ron Lewy had, as he claimed, spoken by telephone to a German company and received certain assurances about copyright arrangements in Australia in respect of CDs which Mr Lewy's company was about to import. The trial judge had not accepted that the words were said. In the Full Court Tamberlin J said at 14-15: The submission made to this court is that because it was not specifically and expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy, in cross-examination, that the statement was not made, the rule of professional practice enunciated in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 was breached and therefore the evidence should have been ignored or the matter reopened. The failure by his Honour to address the point was said to amount to procedural unfairness. Counsel referred to a number of decisions including Payless Superbarn (NSW) Pty Ltd v O'Gara (1990) 19 NSWLR 551 at 554 7. Ultimately, the rule in Browne v Dunn is one of procedural fairness. Whether his Honour should have taken any action in relation to the failure to put the disputed words called for the exercise of a discretionary judgment on his part. As Hunt J has pointed out, in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 26 7; (1983) 44 ALR 607 , the rule is designed to ensure fairness to the witness so as to enable the witness to deal with the disputed matter and perhaps to give further evidence in corroboration or to contradict any inference which may be sought to be drawn.

It is common ground that it was not expressly put to Mr Ron Lewy that the words were not said. In commercial litigation (including intellectual property matters), where issues are clearly defined, there will often be no point in formally challenging every aspect of the evidence which is contested. There will often be a large number of matters in respect of which it will be apparent from the pleadings and particulars there is clearly a contest. Where this is the case the principle need not be applied in an unduly technical way. After discussing the evidence, his Honour continued: The rule may be satisfied where the witness is on notice that the version given is disputed and such notice may come from pleadings, the opponent's evidence or opening, or from the general manner in which the case is conducted.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.086,0.053,0.862,0.9214,6.1949000000000005

Case840,Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226,"Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 , I said that determination of the question of the ""proper"" claimant group is not properly a subject for determination on a strike out application. I said at [7] and [8]: 7 Whether the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people was a wider group of people than Mr Bodney's immediate family was a matter of serious dispute before the primary judge. William Warrell and Margaret Gentle had sworn affidavits consistent with the view that the Ballaruk and Didjarruk people was a wider group than Mr Bodney's immediate family. However, Mr Warrell and Ms Gentle were not cross-examined, even though it is plain that Mr Bodney disputed the accuracy and indeed the truthfulness of the claims that they made in their respective affidavits. 8 Resolution of that factual question is, in my respectful view, not properly the subject for determination on a strike-out application. The finding of lack of authorisation (or, more precisely, the primary judge's finding that Mr Bodney had failed to establish authorisation in either of the ways contemplated by s 251B of the Act), was dependent on the factual finding by the primary judge on that question. In my judgment, it is not appropriate at this time and on this application to determine those issues. Three of the persons who have executed affidavits for Mr Delaney, namely, Neville Isaacs Jnr, Ervyn Isaacs, and Stella Isaacs, are respondents to the principal proceedings, and therefore are entitled to be heard on those issues in the proceeding. It is a curious feature of the present application that it is contended that there are alternative bases for the authorisation to change the composition of the applicant. The primary submission is that Ms Connie Isaacs, on 9 February, made the decision, and she, as Elder was entitled to make that decision for the purposes of s 251B(a) of the Act. The traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group, it was said, gave the authority to make that decision to Ms Isaacs as Elder. That was the basis on which Ms Isaacs made the original application. In the present case, all but one of the adult members of the native title claim group (as expressed in the original application) have acquiesced and acceded to this particular exercise of authority by Ms Isaacs, after there was consultation among members of the claim group as to what was proposed. The remaining adult member, Jodie Briggs, has previously acknowledged the authority of Ms Isaacs as Elder. The curious feature is that it was submitted that if the Court was not satisfied that the decision of Ms Connie Isaacs as Elder was the process of decision making under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the Turrbal native title claim group, there had nonetheless been a decision made to authorise Ms Isaacs and Ms Barambah pursuant to a process of decision making agreed to and adopted by the persons in the native title claim group, to be inferred from the conduct of the members of the native title claim group between 9 February and 15 June 2007, when the senior members of the Turrbal group met for the purpose of making a decision. That decision was subsequently ratified by as many adult members of the Turrbal claim group as practicable (indeed, by all but one), and the resolution initially passed on 9 February 2007, having subsequently been ratified by all but one adult members of the native title claim group, constituted a sufficient authorisation within the requirements of the Act. There is simply no evidence that that method of decision making was the process of decision making required to be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group. The original application was not authorised by that process and, it seems to me, the alternative form of authorisation contended for factually is at odds with the primary contention of the applicant concerning authorisation, namely, that Ms Connie Isaacs as Elder had the authority of the native title claim group to make the original application, because that was the decision making process mandated by the traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group. If Connie Isaacs had authority on that basis to make the original application, she similarly had authority on the same basis to make the decision to change the constitution of the applicant from Ms Connie Isaacs to Ms Connie Isaacs and Maroochy Barambah. Both Helen Bowskill, counsel for the State of Queensland, and Mr Peter Flanagan SC for the Commonwealth submitted that s 66B assumes that the current applicant (who is sought to be replaced by the current applicant and her daughter) had authority to bring the claim at the time the claim was made: s 66B(1)(a)(i).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.018,0.913,0.9845,6.39475

It may be, as submitted by Mr Wright on behalf of the State, that the requirement to ""consider"" the application does not include a requirement to determine the application. It may be open to the Court, having considered the merits of an application, to decide to defer a ruling on it until the trial of the principal application. Whether or not that is so, it is clearly the policy of the Act that the Court should give immediate attention to a strike out motion. The reason, no doubt, is that it is undesirable to allow parties to be put to trouble and expense in relation to an application that fails to comply with the fundamental requirements stated in ss 61, 61A and 62.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.071,0.06,0.869,0.2755,3.9532500000000006
Case842,Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31,"J in Harrington-Smith on behalf of the Wongatha People v State of Western Australia (No 9) [2007] FCA 31 refers to the distinction between people who claim to hold common or group rights and interests, and those who actually hold those common or group rights and interests. Lindgren J said at [1189] [1193]: 1189 [That result] is an odd use of language. It is a natural use of language to designate the group of persons on whose behalf a claimant application is made, as 'a claim group', whether or not the application proves to be successful, and those persons, 'including the applicants', as 'claimants'. Yet the expression 'native title claim group' is defined in the NTA as being, relevantly, all the actual holders, according to their traditional laws and customs, of the particular native title claimed: NTA ss 253, 61(1). It follows that there cannot be an authorisation within s 61(1) unless there are actual holders of the particular native title claimed. 1190 Logically, the authorisation issue can be finally determined only after I determine whether there are actual holders of the particular native title claimed, and if so, who they are. Since I decide below that there are no holders of the particular native title claimed, the making of the present application could not have been authorised by all of those persons. 1191 Authorisation was addressed extensively in submissions. I will address the issue independently of my conclusion that there are no actual holders of the particular native title claimed. I will address it as if I were dealing with a strike out application under s 84C. 1192 How does s 84C, which assumes that it may be possible for an application to be struck out prior to the final determination of an application, accommodate the fact that the native title claim group is defined to mean the actual holders of the particular native title claimed? In my opinion, the answer is that the striking out remedy is available once it clearly appears that, if the application were to succeed according to its own terms, the applicants would not have been authorised by all those persons the Court would determine to be the actual holders of the particular native title claimed, that is to say, by all the members of the 'claim group' (all the 'claimants'). 1193 I will take this approach also to the challenges to authorisation of all Claims before the Court, that is to say, I will assume that the claimants identified in the Form 1 are actual holders of the particular native title claimed in that Form. The opposition by Mr Delaney to the granting of the relief sought by the notice of motion depends on establishing that the claimant group, as contended for by the applicant Connie Isaacs, is wrong, and that Connie Isaacs does not, and never had, the authorisation of the correct claimant group. The observations of Lindgren J in [1192] above indicate that a strike out application would depend on whether it was established that the applicant was not authorised by all the members of the claim group, ie, all the ""claimants"". The question of whether all the ""claimants"" constitute the persons who actually hold the common or group rights and interests confirming the particular native title claimed, or whether the persons who actually hold those rights and interests is a wider group (as Mr Delaney contends), being a factual dispute, is not properly the subject of determination on a strike out application.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.057,0.031,0.912,0.9403,6.2650500000000005
Case843,Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178,"J (with whom North J at [1] and Dowsett J at [10] agreed) in Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 said, at [53]: 53. Section 66B assumes that the current applicant, who is sought to be replaced, had authority to bring the claim at the time the claim was made: s 66B(1)(a)(i). The hearing of a s 66B motion is not the proper occasion to explore the broader issue as to whether or not a native title determination application was properly authorised in the first place for the purposes of s 61 and s 251B of the Act. Such an issue can be explored either in the course of a strike-out application under s 84C of the Act, or at the trial of the application. Lander J discussed the operation of s 84C and the question of proper authorisation at [54] to [59] inclusive: 54 ... in this case, where the appellant contended that the first respondent was never authorised to bring the native title application, the appellant has adopted the correct procedure, which is to proceed under s 84C. 55 Section 84C(2) requires the Court to consider the application to strike out 'before any further proceedings take place in relation to the main application'. 56 That subsection recognises that if an application under s 84C is successful the application for native title will be struck out. Because of the possible consequences of the application, it is in all parties' interests that the application be heard before any other steps are taken in relation to the main application. The subsection requires the Court to 'consider the application made under subsection (1)'. The subsection does not require the Court to determine the application before any further steps are taken. The use of the word 'consider' without an obligation on the Court to also 'determine' the application is deliberate. 57 In some cases it will be appropriate to determine the application at the same time as it is considered. Where the application to strike out is obviously without merit then it may be dismissed immediately. Where the application is clearly a case that calls for relief under the section, recognising that relief will be provided sparingly as I have described it, then an order will be made dismissing the main application. In many cases, an applicant faced with an application under s 84C will apply to amend the application to cure an identified deficiency. For example, where an application is based upon an applicant's failure to comply with s 62 in supplying the details under that section, an applicant might respond by amending the application to make it comply. In those cases, the Court will not be called upon to determine the s 84C application. 58 In some cases it may be difficult to decide whether the application should succeed. For example, it may be difficult to decide, on the papers, whether the applicant has been authorised by the native title claim group. 59 In that case it may be appropriate to hear and determine the application under s 84C at the same time as the main application. ... If Ms Isaacs had authority as Elder to make the original application, as I hold on the authority of Williams v Grant s 66B assumes she had, she therefore had authority as Elder to decide on an altered composition of the applicant. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that it is proper to grant the relief sought by the notice of motion.

She commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court in which she sought re-instatement to her former position, compensation and costs. At trial, she abandoned her claim for re-instatement and advised the Court that she sought compensation and an apology. The proceeding was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate: see Kang v Attorney-General's Department [2008] FMCA 638. 3 The respondent (who was, by order of this Court, identified as the Commonwealth of Australia) opposed the application and sought its costs. The Federal Magistrate did not rule on the costs application. 4 Ms Kang lodged an appeal in this Court. The Commonwealth cross-appealed on the costs issue.

There was no reason why Mr Kennedy would have been aware of any of Ms Kang's absences because of illness. It had not been put to him that he was aware of any such absences or that he had acted because of them. His Honour rejected the claim, insofar as it was based on s 659(2)(e) on the basis that it was well settled that the paragraph did not apply where all that the employee had done was to make a complaint directly to his or her employer: see Zhang at [19]-[30]; Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd (2007) 167 IR 144 at [110]-[112].

Case849,Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2007) 237 ALR 672,"Section 666 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) provides that a party must not be ordered to pay the costs of any other party in a proceeding alleging a contravention of s 659 of the Act unless the Court is satisfied that the applicant instituted the proceedings without (inter alia) reasonable cause. The respondent contended that the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court had been instituted without reasonable cause and that it had no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure: see Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2007) 237 ALR 672 at 685. This was because Ms Kang did not produce any evidence capable of supporting her application and because the case she presented to the Court amounted to a mere allegation which could be rebutted by a simple denial by the respondent. 62 Ms Kang's application to the Federal Magistrates Court, insofar as it alleged a contravention of s 659(2)(e) , was bound to fail. Her own evidence established that she had not made any complaint to any external authority. In the absence of such a complaint, for reasons already given, she could not succeed. 63 It cannot, however, in my opinion, be said that her complaint alleging a contravention of s 659(2)(a) had no prospects of success or was doomed to fail. Ms Kang gave undisputed evidence about a series of absences from work which commenced in mid February 2007. She was absent when the decision was made to terminate her employment. She had provided the Attorney-General's Department with medical certificates to explain her absences. This evidence alone was, of course, not sufficient to make good a claim of contravention of s 659(2)(a). It was, however, sufficient, having regard to the provisions of s 664(b) , to require more than a mere denial on the part of the respondent. The respondent did not, apparently, consider that a mere denial would suffice. It accepted that it was necessary to call Mr Kennedy to give evidence about when he made his decision, why he made it and his knowledge (or lack of it) of the medical certificates and Ms Kang's absences prior to his making the decision.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.071,0.091,0.838,-0.7973,0.2294499999999995
Case850,SZJUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 439,"This is an appeal from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett given on 21 March 2007: SZJUK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 439. His Honour dismissed, with costs, an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") signed on 25 October 2006 and given on 14 November 2006. 2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He arrived in Australia on 20 October 2004. On 3 December 2004 he applied for a protection (class XA) visa. On 7 March 2005 a delegate of the respondent Minister refused that application. The appellant then sought review of that decision from the Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 4 August 2005. The appellant then sought judicial review. 3 On 5 June 2006 Federal Magistrate Barnes made orders by consent quashing the Tribunal's decision and remitting the application for reconsideration. The appellant was then invited to attend a second Tribunal hearing, which he did. Ultimately, the Tribunal rejected his application. In doing so, it found that his evidence was not credible, largely because the claims that he advanced before the first Tribunal differed in certain respects from his claims before the second Tribunal. 4 The appellant's claims can be briefly stated. He says that he is a member of Falun Gong, and that by reason of that fact, he faces persecution if required to return to China. 5 In his application for a protection visa the appellant said that he was born in Fujian, China, in 1972 and was married in 1996. His wife and daughter continue to reside in China. He said that he was a sales/department manager prior to coming to Australia, and had held that position from March 2003 to October 2004. He claimed that he had been unemployed from February 1996 until February 2003 and that prior to that he had been a construction worker and a farmer. He claimed that he left China legally using a passport issued in his name in Fujian in November 2002 which would expire in November 2007. He claimed that he had had difficulties, which he detailed as ""bribery"", obtaining his passport. He claimed that his passport was not valid for return to China because ""it must have been blacklisted"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.034,0.02,0.946,0.5719,4.98765
Case851,Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557,"The Tribunal then turned its attention to the question of compassionate and compelling circumstances, for the purpose of determining whether reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations was applicable. At [74], it referred to Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557. In that case, the Court was dealing with an earlier version of item 820.211 in Sch 2 to the Migration Regulations , in which there was a requirement to satisfy several criteria found in Sch 3, 'unless the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for not applying those criteria.' Relying on an explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister at the time when this provision had been inserted into the Migration Regulations , which described the provision as a 'waiver provision', Wilcox J held at [33] that it was clear that the 'compelling circumstances' criterion was intended to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa, not at the time of decision, because item 820.211 in its entirety was required to be satisfied at the time of application. Discussing the effect of this case at [76] of its reasons, the Tribunal said: 'The Tribunal notes that the Court in Boakye-Danquah was not concerned about whether compassionate and compelling circumstances applied to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement. However, the Court clearly stated that the relevant criterion in that case was concerned with ""the circumstances in which the application is made"". The 12 month cohabitation requirement is also clearly concerned with the circumstances in which the application is made. This requirement may only be waived if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A. If the Tribunal was to take into account compassionate and compelling circumstances which apply only at the time of the decision it would be, in effect, making a determination in relation a [ sic ] time of application requirement by reference to facts which did not yet exist at the time of application. Such a determination would entirely undermine the two-stage assessment process which underpins the regulations. That is, an assessment of relevant factors which exist at the time of application and a later assessment of factors which exist at the time of decision.' 46 At [77], the Tribunal purported to apply Boakye-Danquah in assessing whether there were compelling and compassionate circumstances justifying what it called 'the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement at the time of application.' It expressed a finding that the only circumstances which could properly be taken into account 'in determining whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement are those circumstances which applied at the time of application.' After referring to other authority, the Tribunal then said at [81]: 'Policy provides that, in assessing whether there are compelling and compassionate reasons, officers are to take into account the circumstances which the Minister considers to be compelling and compassionate which includes, but is not limited to, applicants who have a dependent child of the relationship. The parties should be given the opportunity to present information as to why they consider there are compelling and compassionate reasons to waive the one year pre-existing cohabitation requirement. However, it is the policy intention that an assessment that the parties' relationship is genuine would not, in the absence of a dependent child of the relationship, be sufficiently compelling to justify not applying regulation 1.15A(2)(d) requirements.' 47 At [82], the Tribunal found that there were no dependent children of the relationship, and that there was no evidence that the parties were affected by extreme hardship at the time of application or that they would suffer irreparable prejudice if the 12-month cohabitation period were not waived. It referred to the relationship between Mr Petrou and the two children of his former marriage and to the fact that he had lived away from them for some time. It took the view that Mr Petrou would be able to prepare his children psychologically for his departure from Australia to be with Ms Antipova. The Tribunal found that it was not satisfied that a close relationship existed between Mr Petrou and his children at the time of application and was not satisfied that the relationship amounted to compassionate and compelling circumstances at that time. It was also not satisfied that the current needs of Mr Petrou's children were sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12-month cohabitation requirement, even if it could properly take those circumstances into account. 48 Three documents filed on behalf of Ms Antipova, and oral submissions of her counsel at the hearing of the proceeding, disclosed a great variety of approaches to the case put on her behalf. Some of the points raised can be dealt with very briefly, whereas others require a more detailed examination. The three documents are the amended application, filed on 8 June 2004, contentions of fact and law, also filed on 8 June 2004, and contentions in response to the respondent's supplementary contentions, filed on 2 May 2005. 103 The Tribunal construed this provision as a 'waiver' provision, and held that it was required to take into account only those circumstances existing at the date of the application for a visa. In doing so, the Tribunal said that it was following Boakye-Danquah . That was a case concerned with criteria for a particular type of visa, found in a schedule to the Migration Regulations , in which the reference to 'compelling reasons' appeared in the very criterion required to be satisfied at the time of application for the visa. That provision referred to compelling reasons for not applying certain otherwise applicable criteria. It is not surprising that Wilcox J in that case construed the relevant provision as requiring the compelling reasons to exist at the time of application for the visa. 104 Regulation 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations is a very different provision. It is found in a separate regulation, providing a definition of the word 'spouse', for a variety of purposes, wherever that word is found in the Migration Regulations . It does not call upon a decision-maker to determine 'whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement', as the Tribunal characterised it at [77] of its reasons. Rather, reg 1.15A(2A) provides that reg 1.15A(2)(d) does not apply if a specified condition is met. That condition is not that the applicant can establish compelling and compassionate reasons for not applying the criteria referred to in reg 1.15A(2)(d), but that the applicant can establish 'compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.' In other words, the Tribunal is not required to determine whether compelling and compassionate circumstances exist for the waiver or non-application of the 12-month requirement, but whether such circumstances exist for the granting of the visa sought. The focus is not on the criteria to be ousted from consideration, but on the end result. The wording of reg 1.15A(2A) suggests strongly that, at whatever stage of whatever decision-making process the question of special circumstances arises, it is to be determined by reference to whatever circumstances exist at the date of decision. It would be a strange result if the circumstances to be considered differed according to whether the application of the definition of 'spouse' was required to be applied at the time of application of the visa, or at the time of decision, or at some other stage, so that different views might be taken as to whether compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa existed at different times. The wording of the provision suggests strongly that this is not the intention. 105 Applying this view does nothing to undermine the two-stage assessment process of determining entitlement to the type of visa Ms Antipova sought, as the Tribunal suggested at [76] of its reasons. Even assuming the definition in reg 1.15A of the Migration Regulations to be confined in its application to that type of visa (and subreg (2)(d) in its terms applies to a range of types of visas, including any permanent visa), the two-stage process remains intact. In determining whether the applicant for a visa was the spouse of a nominating person at the date of application for the visa, the decision-maker is required to determine whether, throughout a 12-month period prior to that date, the two persons met the three requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d), namely mutual commitment, genuine and continuing relationship, and cohabitation. If any of these three requirements should be absent, the decision-maker is then required to consider whether the applicant has established compelling and compassionate reasons for the grant of the visa. If so, reg 1.15A(2)(d) no longer has to be satisfied at the date of application for the visa; it no longer applies. Once understood in this sense, reg 1.15A(2A) can be seen to be compatible with the two-stage process of assessment. On this analysis, there is nothing strange about making a determination about the application of a criterion to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa by reference to facts not in existence at that time, as the Tribunal thought. 107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A). 108 The Tribunal appears to have been led into error by its misunderstanding of the principle for which Boakye-Danquah stood as authority, and by its incorrect characterisation of reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations, at [76] of the Tribunal's reasons, as permitting waiver of the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) 'if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A.' As I have said in [104], reg 1.15A(2A) did not focus on the circumstances attending the making of the application for a visa, but on the circumstances justifying the granting of the visa. Those circumstances are the ones the Tribunal was required to take into account in determining whether the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) was applicable. 109 Such an error is capable of amounting to a jurisdictional error if it affected the exercise of the Tribunal's statutory function. In the present case, the issue of compelling and compassionate circumstances turned on Mr Petrou's re-established relationship with his children from a former union, and on Ms Antipova's emerging relationship with those children. The Tribunal was prepared to take into account the needs of those children in determining whether compelling and compassionate circumstances existed. Having held that it could not take into account the circumstances that existed at the date of decision, the Tribunal nevertheless expressed the view at [82] of its reasons that, even if it could do so, it did not regard the current needs of the children as 'sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement'. Despite the incorrect characterisation of the effect of reg 1.15A(2A), it is fair to take this finding to be a finding that there were no compelling and compassionate circumstances, for the purposes of the application of that provision, even if current circumstances were to be considered. The assessment of the circumstances against the standard of 'compelling and compassionate' was a matter for the Tribunal. It does not appear that the Tribunal misunderstood or misapplied the required standard. The result, therefore, is the same as if the Tribunal had not held erroneously that it could not take circumstances at the time of the decision into account. In effect, it did so. Its error did not amount to a jurisdictional error, because it did carry out the task required of it by the legislation. 110 For this reason, the Tribunal's decision cannot be set aside on the basis of its error in construing reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.104,0.035,0.861,0.9993,6.42855
Case852,Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788,"In determining whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had been in a de facto relationship for 12 months or more prior to the visa application, the Tribunal was bound to have regard to all of the matters referred to in reg 1.15A(3) of the Migration Regulations . That subregulation so provides and, as the Tribunal pointed out at [48] of its reasons, the mandatory nature of the provision was emphasised in Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788 at [10] . In conformity with its obligation, the Tribunal discussed in its reasons for decision each of those matters, to the extent to which there was evidence before the Tribunal relating to them. It did so under headings reflecting the requirements of pars (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively of reg 1.15A(3). This arrangement of the Tribunal's reasons for decision makes it difficult for Ms Antipova to sustain the argument that the Tribunal failed to consider the mandatory considerations. 61 In its consideration of the financial aspects of the relationship, required by reg 1.15A(3)(a) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal first found that there was no evidence that, in the 12-month period it was considering, the parties combined their financial affairs or shared assets or liabilities. It acknowledged that Ms Antipova had given a reason for the lack of a joint bank account, namely that she and Mr Petrou had little money and there was no need. The Tribunal pointed out that there was no documentary evidence of shared household or daily living expenses in the relevant 12-month period, but appeared to accept that it would have been impractical to have had such evidence, because Mr Petrou was the sole lessee of the six-bedroom house in California in which Ms Antipova claimed to have lived with him and others. The Tribunal clearly did not focus solely on whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had a joint bank account, as the submissions on behalf of Ms Antipova suggested. Nor did it ignore evidence of the joint burden of debt for legal expenses, loans and university fees. To the extent that such a joint burden might have existed, it plainly did not exist during the 12 months preceding the application for a visa. Indeed, as late as 1 September 2003, Ms Antipova's migration agent (who was also, apparently, a legal practitioner) submitted in writing to the Tribunal the statement that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou 'do not have joint financial commitments because of their parlous financial position.' The Tribunal could hardly have made any finding other than the one it made on this aspect of the case. In weighing the credibility of Ms Antipova's case, the Tribunal was certainly entitled to use material that Ms Antipova had supplied to it, concerning the travel undertaken by her and Mr Petrou, when testing their assertion that, because they had very little money, they did not open a joint bank account and Ms Antipova did not apply for a divorce from her former husband. The material was relevant to this issue, and there was no element of conjecture involved in the Tribunal's reliance on it. 62 In considering the social aspects of the relationship during the 12-month period, as required by reg 1.15A(3)(c) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal dealt expressly with the material supplied by Ms Antipova from friends and family. As I have already pointed out, it gave little weight to the statements of Ms Downie, Ms Shpits and Ms Karagoz. It did not reject the statements as evidence that family and friends considered Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou to be a couple, and thereby used the statements for the purpose for which they were required under the regulation, and for the purpose for which they had been supplied to it. The Tribunal did point out, however, that the statements of Mr Petrou's parents did not bear upon whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were living together at the relevant time. Since this was the crucial issue, the Tribunal could not be criticised for making this observation, although it did so under the heading dealing with the social aspects of the relationship, rather than under the earlier heading, dealing with the nature of the household, including the living arrangements. The Tribunal did not fail to consider the evidence of travel itineraries, air tickets and passport copies, as Ms Antipova contended. It detailed every document in its reasons for decision. The material indicated that the parties travelled together in March 2002. Although evidence of later events can sometimes cast light on the nature of a relationship at an earlier time, it is hard to see, and counsel for Ms Antipova never explained, how the evidence of joint travel in March 2002 could bear upon the nature of the relationship between Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou in May and June 2001. The Tribunal was not bound to look at this material in relation to the issue of the social aspects of the relationship at the relevant time.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.062,0.032,0.906,0.9732,6.3762
Case853,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611,"The contention that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case, as it was required to do by s 353(2)(b) of the Migration Act , also appears to be an attempt to reargue the merits, and therefore impermissible. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [46] [52] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J (Hayne J concurring at [158]), [69] [77] per Gaudron and Kirby JJ, [106] [109] per Gummow J, and [175] [179] per Callinan J, the High Court held that s 420 of the Migration Act was insufficiently specific to constitute a ground for review of a decision under the limited jurisdiction then given to this Court by s 476 of the Migration Act , which has since been repealed. Section 420 makes provisions with respect to the Refugee Review Tribunal in terms identical to those made by s 353 with respect to the Tribunal. For reasons similar to those given in Eshetu , s 353 is unlikely to be the source of an obligation, failure to comply with which could be said to constitute jurisdictional error. 67 A consideration of whether the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by misleading Ms Antipova about what was in issue requires an examination of further factual matters. On 6 August 2002, Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were interviewed separately by an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (subsequently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (in both cases, 'the Department'). The notes of the interview record that Ms Antipova was asked when and where she moved in with Mr Petrou. Her answer was 18 May 2001, and she gave the address of the premises at which Mr Petrou lived in California. The officer asked if she had any other documents that would support this claim, and Ms Antipova said that she did not. By letter dated 16 August 2002, the officer referred to a request on 6 August 2002 'to provide further evidence of cohabitation within 28 days' and requested certain specified documents. With a letter dated 6 September 2002, Ms Antipova's migration agent provided the statutory declarations of Mr Petrou's parents, the statement of Ms Karagoz and a statement of Mr Petrou. With a letter dated 15 October 2002, the migration agent provided the letter of Ms Downie dated 15 August 2002. 68 The decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse to grant Ms Antipova a visa was accompanied by written reasons, dated 3 January 2003. According to those reasons, the delegate found 'conflicting information about the extent of commitment of this relationship since May 2001'. The delegate found that there was 'inadequate evidence...to support claims of a de facto marital relationship to have been in existence for at least 12 months prior to the date of application' for the visa [underlining in original]. It was for this reason that the delegate decided that Ms Antipova was not entitled to the visa.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.061,0.048,0.891,0.699,5.4335

Case856,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553,"There are two possible answers to this question. The first is that s 360(1) of the Migration Act requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.' If the Tribunal has conducted what purports to be a hearing, but has not in truth allowed an applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to those issues, it has not complied with this statutory obligation. The Tribunal has failed to comply with an essential precondition to making a decision on the applicant's application to review the decision of the Minister's delegate, and has therefore failed to perform the duty, conferred on it by s 348 of the Migration Act , to review that decision. Its decision is invalid and must be set aside. This is the reasoning followed by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [33] [41], in relation to s 425(1) of the Migration Act , which imposes on the Refugee Review Tribunal an obligation in terms identical with the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 360(1). At [33], the Full Court approved the statement of Goldberg J in Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188 at [31] that: 'The invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture.' 84 In SCAR at [38], the Full Court recognised that compliance with s 425 is a 'precondition to the valid exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction', and that failure to comply involves a jurisdictional error. At [41], the Full Court found that the Refugee Review Tribunal in that case had not extended 'a meaningful invitation'. 85 In the present case, because it interrupted her and imposed an arbitrary time limit on her, the Tribunal did not permit Ms Antipova to give evidence and present arguments as she wished to do. Although there was a semblance of a hearing, and the Tribunal invited Ms Antipova to it in terms mandated by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , the invitation was not a real and meaningful one, because what she was invited to do was denied to her. The Tribunal failed to observe a precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it. Its decision was made without an invitation to attend a hearing of the kind required, because such a hearing has not yet been conducted. 86 Counsel for the Minister submitted that SCAR has been the subject of judicial criticism, and even that it has been not followed. Reference was made to WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 (2004) 204 ALR 624, in which French J distinguished SCAR on the facts at [46]. At [57] [59], his Honour discussed the question whether s 422B of the Migration Act operated to preclude the application of the principles of procedural fairness in the context of the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to ask any questions at the hearing as to a particular issue on which it later found adversely to the person seeking a protection visa. In the course of that discussion, his Honour examined whether there had been a failure to comply with s 425 of the Migration Act . In the alternative, his Honour examined the issue on the assumption that s 425 had no application, holding that the denial of procedural fairness in that case amounted to jurisdictional error, notwithstanding s 422B. Nothing that his Honour said in that passage amounted to a criticism of SCAR , or a refusal to follow it. Indeed, at [58], his Honour affirmed the central propositions for which SCAR stands, saying: 'A failure to conduct a hearing of the kind contemplated by s 425 in my opinion would amount to a failure to comply with the obligation imposed by that section upon the tribunal to invite an applicant to participate in such a hearing. That obligation is so central to the conduct of the tribunal process that it necessarily conditions the power to make an adverse decision on review.' 87 In M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 (2005) 85 ALD 597, Ryan J also dealt with the alleged failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to raise at the hearing an issue on which it later found against the person applying for a protection visa. At [58], his Honour accepted that compliance with s 425 was held in SCAR to be a precondition to the valid exercise of the Refugee Review Tribunal's jurisdiction, and that failure to comply would therefore be jurisdictional error. At [59], his Honour quoted from the joint judgment of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Cho [1999] FCA 946 (1999) 92 FCR 315 at [29] , where their Honours said: 'In considering the extent of the requirements imposed by s 425 it is important to keep in mind that the exercise is essentially one of statutory interpretation...Care must be taken not to confuse the question of the interpretation of s 425 according to its language with a question as to whether the full range of natural justice requirements should be injected into s 425 under the guise of giving content to an obligation to afford an ""opportunity to give evidence"".' 90 At [62], Ryan J quoted from NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [30] , a passage in which the Full Court recognised that the invitation required by s 425 must be 'real and meaningful and not just an empty gesture', citing both SCAR and Mazhar . The Full Court in NALQ proceeded to discuss earlier authorities on the nature of the invitation required. At [34], there was a discussion of whether the Full Court in SCAR at [37] had misconstrued the judgment of Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 (2003) 128 FCR 359, but the Full Court in NALQ did not determine this question. 91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority. The invitation required by s 425 of the Migration Act (and, for identical reasons, that required by s 360), must be real and genuine. As the reasoning of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Cho at [33] demonstrates, it is legitimate to examine what occurred at the hearing, in order to ascertain whether the invitation extended satisfies that requirement. If what took place under the guise of a hearing was not a genuine opportunity for an applicant for review 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to a decision under review', then the invitation required by s 425 (or s 360) will not have been extended as required. Of course, it is necessary to bear in mind, as Tamberlin and Katz JJ said in Cho at [29], that it is not legitimate to regard every want of procedural fairness as nullifying the invitation. It is only defects rendering the proceedings ineffective to fulfil the purpose for which the invitation is required that will have this effect. SCAR is therefore binding on me as a single judge. In any event, in my view, it is correctly decided. 93 If SCAR is wrongly decided, and s 360(1) of the Migration Act is not to be given the meaning it bears in my opinion, it is necessary to consider the second answer to the question whether s 357A of the Migration Act ousts the right, which Ms Antipova would have otherwise, to establish that the Tribunal's unfairness to her constitutes jurisdictional error, entitling her to have the Tribunal's decision set aside. Section 357A is a difficult provision to construe. It does not exclude altogether the principles of procedural fairness. There must be some doubt as to whether Parliament could exclude procedural fairness altogether, given that a denial of procedural fairness is a ground for the remedies referred to in s 75(v) of the Constitution . At best, the legislative power extends to regulating procedures, and this is what s 357A attempts to do. It provides that Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act is taken to be 'an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with'. The provision assumes that there will be aspects of the 'natural justice hearing rule' that are not matters dealt with by any provision of Div 5. As the cases so far have shown, identifying a provision dealing with a particular 'matter', relating to procedural fairness is not always easy. See, for example, the passages in WAJR , to which I have referred in [86]. The present case is relatively easy. No provision of Div 5 deals with the imposition of time limits on the hearings of the Tribunal. Unless it be s 360(1) , no provision deals with the process by which evidence is adduced at a Tribunal hearing. There is certainly no provision dealing with the 'matter' of a Tribunal member interrupting answers to questions. No provision gives the Tribunal member a right to control and censor the evidence given, by refusing to hear what the applicant for review wishes to say.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.075,0.093,0.831,-0.9831,-0.42585000000000006
Case857,Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188,"There are two possible answers to this question. The first is that s 360(1) of the Migration Act requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.' If the Tribunal has conducted what purports to be a hearing, but has not in truth allowed an applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to those issues, it has not complied with this statutory obligation. The Tribunal has failed to comply with an essential precondition to making a decision on the applicant's application to review the decision of the Minister's delegate, and has therefore failed to perform the duty, conferred on it by s 348 of the Migration Act , to review that decision. Its decision is invalid and must be set aside. This is the reasoning followed by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [33] [41], in relation to s 425(1) of the Migration Act , which imposes on the Refugee Review Tribunal an obligation in terms identical with the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 360(1).

According to its terms the section simply requires that an opportunity be given to the applicant to appear and give evidence. Obviously if there is no real opportunity given then the section has not been complied with. This could arise, for example, where relevant evidence is not admitted or misleading statements are made by the decision-maker which discourage an applicant from calling or proceeding with a particular line of evidence.' 91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority.

Case865,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61,"Since writing these reasons for judgment, I have become aware of the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61. That judgment deals with an appeal by the Minister from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which quashed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse a Business Skills Migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal, a person who had applied from outside Australia for that visa. The issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the Full Court called 'common law procedural fairness', because the decision-maker did not draw to the respondent's attention the point on which the decision against him turned. If the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue, there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51A of the Migration Act , a provision in terms similar to both s 357A and s 422B , but relating to decisions by the Minister or delegates of the Minister. At [46] [59], the Full Court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness, because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent. The Full Court then proceeded, at [60] [70], to make some observations, which are clearly obiter, on the effect of s 51A. Following VXDC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 (2005) 146 FCR 562, the Full Court expressed the view that s 51A operates to exclude the 'common law natural justice hearing rule' altogether. 97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result. 98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'. 99 For these reasons, if it is necessary to ask the question whether Ms Antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the Tribunal denied her procedural fairness, by the manner in which it conducted her hearing, I do not regard VXDC and Lay Lat as requiring me to take a view different from that I have expressed above.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.065,0.038,0.898,0.9768,6.3948

Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.056,0.032,0.911,0.8885,6.082750000000001
Case868,Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596,"To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress.

Case869,Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141,"It is therefore necessary to see whether the particular denial of procedural fairness made a difference, in the sense referred to in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 147, ie whether the Tribunal's error deprived Ms Antipova 'of the possibility of a successful outcome.' In the present case, the answer is plain. The Tribunal disbelieved Ms Antipova when she said that she was determined to make a life with Mr Petrou from the time she went to live with him on 18 May 2001. To a significant extent, the Tribunal's reasoning in this respect was based on its refusal to accept Ms Antipova's explanation of how she had come to continue with her marriage plans after meeting Mr Petrou, and then abandoned her marriage so soon after she had undertaken it. It was this very question that Ms Antipova was attempting to answer when the Tribunal member interrupted her, on several occasions, and asked her for a less detailed answer. If the Tribunal had been patient enough to listen to the detail, it might well have been persuaded to accept what Ms Antipova said. In other words, the very point on which Ms Antipova lost, because she was disbelieved, is one on which she would have given a fuller explanation, if the Tribunal had permitted her to do so. It cannot be said that the denial of procedural fairness in truncating Ms Antipova's evidence, to fit within a timetable about which she had not been warned, could have made no difference to the outcome of the proceeding. 101 It follows that the performance of the Tribunal's statutory function was affected by the denial of procedural fairness. The Tribunal's decision is therefore tainted by jurisdictional error, either because of its failure to comply with s 360 of the Migration Act , or because of a denial of procedural fairness, which s 357A of the Migration Act does not exclude from consideration. 102 Once the Tribunal had found that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had not been in a marriage-like relationship for 12 months before Ms Antipova applied for her visa, it was necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether reg 1.15A(2A)(b) of the Migration Regulations applied. The effect of that provision was that the requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d) (in this case, the requirement of a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others for a period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of the application for a visa) did not apply if Ms Antipova could 'establish compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.078,0.053,0.869,0.8808,6.0578
Case870,Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478,"In Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478 at [19] [28], the Court took a view similar to the one I have expressed, with respect to the provisions of reg 3A of the Migration Regulations 1989 (Cth). Regulation 3A(2) provided for the specification of a lesser period than the six-month period of cohabitation prior to the date of application for a visa, required by reg 3A(1), if : '(a) there are exceptional circumstances affecting the persons; and (b) there are compelling reasons for specifying that lesser period.' 107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A).",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.067,0.021,0.912,0.9393,6.24155
Case871,Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41,"Nor does it appear that the Tribunal's decision can be set aside on the ground of bias. The ground was raised, but not argued in detail. The test for ostensible bias as a ground for setting aside a decision of the Tribunal is whether a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material objective facts might entertain a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question in issue. See Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67-68 per Deane J. In my view, a fair-minded lay observer, informed as to the material objective facts, who witnessed the Tribunal dealing with Ms Antipova's case, would have been more likely to conclude that the Tribunal had simply not performed its statutory function very well, rather than that it would fail to bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of Ms Antipova's case. The insistence on imposing a time limit, and the associated interruptions and attempts to shorten the evidence, were indicative of a desire to deal with the matter expeditiously, rather than of a desire to find against Ms Antipova, whatever the evidence might reveal. Nothing about the Tribunal's reasoning discloses that it approached the case with a closed mind. 112 For the reasons I have given, the Tribunal's decision is flawed by reason of its jurisdictional error. That error consists of failure to comply with the essential precondition to the exercise of the jurisdiction, provided by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , that the Tribunal invite the applicant to appear before it, to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. Although the Tribunal gave Ms Antipova such an invitation in form, because of the manner in which it conducted the hearing, there was no such invitation in reality. Alternatively, the Tribunal denied Ms Antipova procedural fairness by the manner in which it conducted the hearing, and the denial of procedural fairness is such as to amount to jurisdictional error. Ms Antipova is entitled to have the decision set aside, and to have the Tribunal rehear her application for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.051,0.11,0.838,-0.9794,-0.37190000000000056
Case872,SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162,"Among the relief Ms Antipova seeks is a writ of certiorari, for the purpose of quashing the Tribunal's decision, as well as an order remitting the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law (in reality, a writ of mandamus, or an order in the nature of mandamus). Relief of these kinds can only be granted against the Tribunal, which is not a party to the proceeding. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [43] per McHugh J, [91] per Gummow J, [153] per Kirby J and [180] per Hayne J. It will therefore be necessary for me to make an order joining the Tribunal as the second respondent to the proceeding. It is safe to assume that the Tribunal would follow the usual practice of submitting to any order that the Court might make, save an order for costs against the Tribunal. Service of the application and associated material on the Tribunal can therefore be dispensed with. A writ of certiorari should issue, directed to the Tribunal, bringing the decision into the Court, for the purpose of quashing it. The decision should be quashed. A writ of mandamus should also issue, directed to the Tribunal, requiring it to hear and determine the application of Ms Antipova for review of the decision of the Minister according to law. 114 No reason was advanced, and none appears, why the usual order, that costs follow the event, should not be made.

Case876,Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137,"In the course of argument, ASIC appeared to suggest there were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege. The qualifications were, first, that the ASIC Act is silent as to whether a person other than a lawyer may refuse to give information on the ground that it would disclose a communication for which the person claims legal privilege. If that observation by ASIC was intended to provide support for a contention that an individual, not a lawyer, could be compelled by ASIC to disclose information for which the individual had a claim for legal professional privilege, then that contention is rejected. It is rejected because it finds no support in the Act and is contrary to authority ( Daniels ). There is no basis for distinguishing between a lawyer and an individual in the context of legal professional privilege. So much is made clear from the express words of s 69 of the ASIC Act . In the circumstances specified (which includes ASIC's powers of investigation, examination and information gathering in Pt 3) , a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book, where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication with the lawyer in their capacity as a lawyer "" unless ... the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement"" (emphasis added): s 69(2). In other words, consistent with authority, the section proceeds on the premise that the holder of the privilege (being the client regardless of whether the client is an individual or a body corporate) must consent to the disclosure of the privilege it holds. No other party is able to waive the privilege; it is the holder of the privilege (the client) that must act inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [17]. Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. 26 On the assumption that, at the outset of a s 19 examination, ASIC told an examinee that legal professional privilege may be availed of by that person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents that would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, then disclosure by an examinee or witness of information in which he or she holds the privilege would constitute an act inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege and privilege would be waived: see Cadbury 246 ALR 137 at [13]. So much may be accepted. It is consistent with the established principles on waiver. 27 If ASIC's submission is intended to suggest that if that same person (for example, an employee, director, consultant to, but not a legal adviser of, a third party) was privy to the privileged communications of the third party, then ASIC could compel production of that privileged information, that contention should be rejected for the reasons outlined in [21] and [22] above.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.11,0.04,0.85,0.9771,6.34985

Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder).

Case878,Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301,"However that may be, the fact of the matter is that ASIC now has possession of information which, at least in theory, could be subject to a valid claim of privilege by AWB. The question then is whether ASIC is entitled to make use of that information, notwithstanding the possible privilege claim, and the answer to that question is yes. As the Court of Appeal in Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 said (at [32]): [A]lthough it is now accepted that legal professional privilege is more than just a rule of evidence or procedure, it is clear that it is not to be characterised as a rule of law conferring individual rights sounding in damages or an injunction to restrain an apprehended or continued breach [ Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 565 (Gummow J)]. Consequently, once information in a privileged document has come into the hands of a party to litigation, even as a result of compulsive process which is later reversed, the fact that the document was and remains privileged does not of itself prevent that party from making use of the information [ Calcraft v Guest [1898] 1 QB 759, 763-4; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 (Gibbs CJ, in diss ), 67, 80 (Mason J, in diss ) 101, 109-110 (Brennan J in diss ), 129 (Dawson J); Trevorrow v State of South Australia (No 4) (2006) 94 SASR 64 , 70 (Doyle CJ), 80 (Debelle J), 101 (White J); Heydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Aust Ed (2004) [25025]. 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] .

Despite differences in language between the TPA and the ASIC Act , no different result ensues. There is no express provision in the ASIC Act abrogating legal professional privilege. Moreover, there is nothing in the ASIC Act supporting the contention that the abrogation of legal professional privilege is a necessary implication: see eg ss 1(1) , 1 (2), 1 (3), Pt 3 and, in particular, ss 68 and 69 . 24 In the course of argument, ASIC appeared to suggest there were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege.

Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. 29 In other words, I accept the contention that although ASIC cannot compel the production of legally privileged communications of a person (ie the ASIC Act does not override or abrogate legal professional privilege), that does not mean that ASIC cannot receive such communications under any circumstances. As ASIC contended, legal professional privilege affords a person immunity from compulsory disclosure of its privileged communication ( Daniels ). That immunity does not prevent receipt by ASIC in the circumstances of the present case of legally privileged information from the examinees and the witnesses where they were not the holder of the privilege. 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] .

Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the ""use immunity"" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104].",Criminal Case,Murder,0.113,0.033,0.855,0.9958,6.4083000000000006

Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder).

Given the arrangements put in place by ASIC (see [9], [11] above), there was no (and could be no) complaint that the examinees were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on their own behalf. 36 I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests). In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt. Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee ""would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost ."" (Emphasis added.) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.207,0.051,0.742,0.9988,6.3398
Case884,Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408,"In early 2008, ASIC received a request from the Australian Federal Police (""the AFP"") that it disclose certain information, including the AWB Information, to the AFP. AWB's solicitors learned of the request from a current employee and three former employees who had been examined by ASIC. Those current and former employees had been contacted by ASIC about the AFP request. ASIC informed them that ASIC was considering whether to provide the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP and, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 , provided each of them with an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP. 4 Upon learning of the proposed disclosure by ASIC, AWB wrote to ASIC on 1 April 2008 seeking an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of information to the AFP including the conditions of the release. ASIC responded on 11 April 2008. At that time, the request was limited to the transcripts of the s 19 examinations. ASIC outlined the terms of the AFP request, its proposal to release the transcripts of the s 19 examinations to the AFP and the conditions upon which that information was proposed to be released. ASIC expressed the view that: It is ASIC's view that the protocols that were applied during the course of the section 19 ASIC Act examinations to ensure that information subject to a valid claim of legal professional privilege was not disclosed were sufficient, and that no privileged information was disclosed during the course of any examinations. ... Further, in light of the conditions on which ASIC proposes to release the examination transcripts to the AFP, and the secrecy provisions imposed on employees of the AFP by section 60A of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 Cth [sic], ASIC does not consider that [AWB's] interests in the confidentiality of any information provided to ASIC by examinees will be adversely affected by the proposed release. Although it is ASIC's view that ... [AWB's] interests will [not] be adversely affected by any decision to release the information to the AFP on the limited basis identified in paragraph 5 above, ASIC proposes to give [AWB] an opportunity to make submissions in relation to the conditions to be imposed on the disclosure of the transcripts of examinations of current or former employees of [AWB] to the AFP under section 127(4) of the ASIC Act . 5 ASIC and AWB's solicitors corresponded for some months. By July 2008, the AFP request had extended to disclosure of the witness statements that had been provided voluntarily by the employees and former employees of AWB. 45 However, that is not the end of the enquiry. The disclosure of the AWB Information by ASIC to the AFP was subject to conditions imposed under s 127(4A) (see [7] above). ASIC's s 127 power to disclose is discretionary: Johns at 428 and 469. The conditions are important. When, as here, conditions are imposed they are enforceable as an equitable obligation. The AFP is affected by the terms on which it received the AWB Information: Johns at 429. The obligation (expressed as a condition) is enforceable, at least, by injunction: Johns at 429. 46 The question which then arises is whether the disclosure of the AWB Information under s 127(4) requires ASIC to observe procedural fairness not only towards the examinee but also a party in the position of AWB consistent with the principles set out in Johns v ASC [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408. The exercise of the statutory power is conditional upon the observance of the rules of natural justice ( Johns at 470; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 , 591 and Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 , 598), but does that natural justice requirement extend to AWB? 47 First, it must be recalled that the AWB Information was protected by disclosure (s 127(1)) subject to the qualifications prescribed in ss (2)-(4). That antecedent right or duty is not determinative. However, it is a relevant factor affecting the exercise by ASIC of its discretionary statutory power to disclose the AWB Information to the AFP. Exercise of the authority conferred by s 127(4) was ""apt to affect adversely"" the interests of the examinees who are prima facie entitled to have the transcripts kept confidential: Johns at 430. It was for that reason, consistent with Johns , that ASIC observed the rules of natural justice and informed each of the examinees that it proposed to disclose the transcripts and gave each examinee an opportunity to oppose: Johns at 430-431. 48 The present case, however, concerns not the examinee but AWB, the employer or previous employer of each examinee. In Johns , McHugh J said (at 472) that ""the need to preserve the confidentiality of ASIC's investigation does not exclude procedural fairness, but reduces its content, perhaps in some circumstances to nothing"". Here, the question of whether or not ASIC was obliged to observe the rules of natural justice in the case of AWB did not arise. Although AWB was not told by ASIC of the proposed disclosures to the AFP, it learned of that fact, was ""given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]"" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. AWB might have persuaded ASIC to accept or adopt its submissions. It did not. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to pursue McHugh J's observation to its end to determine precisely how much the content of procedural fairness may have been reduced with respect to AWB; I need only find (and do find) that the opportunity to be heard that was given to AWB was sufficient. 49 It follows from what I have just said that none of AWB's grounds of review is made out. The specific grounds are disposed of as follows. 50 There was no and could be no constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction or an absence of power contrary to ss 5(1)(c) and (d) of the ADJR Act . AWB's contentions that ASIC was ""[not] empowered by the ASIC Act to obtain confidential and privileged communications from persons other than the holder of the privilege in circumstances where the holder has not expressly or by implication waived the privilege"" is too broad a proposition. ASIC is not empowered to compel production from the privilege-holder and did not do so. 55 In my view, there was no denial of natural justice. AWB was ""given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]"" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. As I have found, this opportunity to be heard was enough to satisfy any requirements of natural justice in the circumstances: see [47] above. Moreover, it is of the utmost importance to recall that in a proceeding of this nature it is neither necessary nor right to decide the merits of the decision. 56 For those reasons, I would dismiss the application and order the applicant to pay the respondent's costs to be taxed in default of agreement.

While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege. 37 But while there may be a question as to what obligations or abilities a person may have in respect of claims of privilege on behalf of third parties, it is clear that there is no requirement in the ASIC Act , which imposes an obligation on ASIC to afford a person or entity (other than the person the subject of the exercise of the compulsory power) (ie the third party itself): 1. an opportunity to intervene or interject in the exercise of the compulsory power over another in order to claim or assert legal professional privilege on behalf of itself: see, in particular Pts 3 and 7 of the ASIC Act ; or 2. notice that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party. See by way of example, May v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 at [31] , [36] and [38] and MM at [36] and [37]. 38 That is not surprising. If ASIC were under an obligation to notify a third party that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party, by what criteria would ASIC determine when and in what circumstances it was required to notify a third party? Would ASIC be required to interrupt an examination upon becoming aware of the prospect of or the fact of information being provided by an examinee which might be the subject of a claim of privilege by a third party? How would ASIC determine if it was properly subject to a claim for legal professional privilege? The list of difficulties is endless and the possibility great that efficient and timely investigation of wrongdoing would be frustrated. 39 Moreover, there are measures that the third party can take to prevent disclosure of its privileged information even in the absence of a right to intervene. First, where an examinee is subject to the exercise of compulsory powers by a government authority and in possession of privileged information where the holder of the privilege is a third party, it is open to the holder of privilege to require or authorise the examinee to assert the holder's privilege to the authority: MM at [33] (cf s 122(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). Of course, the efficacy of this strategy is likely to be limited in situations where the third party does not have prior notice of the examination or other exercise of power over another under the ASIC Act . 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a ""springboard for a claim or defence in litigation"": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816. Put another way, ""the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her [or it]"" is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise: MM at [38]. This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Moreover, although not applicable in the present case (because the third party here is a corporation, which has no privilege against self-incrimination: Daniels at [31]), that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self-incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self-incrimination (s 68(1)) and then provides a ""use immunity"" to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s 19 examination where the requirements of s 68(2) are satisfied: s 68(3) of the ASIC Act . Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the ""use immunity"" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104]. 42 It is well established that ""an administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so"": MM at [40]. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 , 39-40; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 , 347-348.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.184,0.044,0.772,0.9998,6.359299999999999
Case889,Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One.Tel Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1188,"Section 127(1) of the ASIC Act imposes an obligation on ASIC to take all reasonable measures to protect the unauthorised use or disclosure of information given to it in confidence in performance of its functions: Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One.Tel Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1188 at [7] . Section 127(4) provides an exception to that general principle. Where ASIC is satisfied ""particular information"" will assist, for example, the AFP, then disclosure of that ""particular information"" to the AFP will be taken to be an authorised use and disclosure of that ""particular information"". 19 The exercise of the power under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act is the exercise of an additional power in relation to the ""particular information"" identified by ASIC at the time of the request by the AFP. It necessarily will involve consideration of ""information"" that did not exist at the time of the examination (here, the questions and answers recorded in the transcript) or the taking of the witness statement (here, the statement). It will also necessarily involve the consideration of matters that did not exist at the aforementioned times, including the nature of the agency function or power (here, criminal investigation by the AFP) and the usefulness of the information to that exercise of power (here, the conduct of that investigation). Section 127(4A) of the ASIC Act provides that ASIC may impose conditions in relation to disclosure of the ""particular information"" under s 127(4). The conditions imposed by ASIC in respect of the AWB Information are those set out in [7] above. 20 In the present case, the dispositive issue (see [13] above) has two aspects to it. The two aspects to consider are: 1. whether, in exercising the power under s 127(4) , by deciding to pass the AWB Information to the AFP, ASIC failed to consider a relevant matter; and 2. a more basic question of power. For reasons which will become obvious, it is first necessary to deal with the question of power. 21 There is no factual foundation yet established that there is material in the AWB Information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches. However, if the AWB Information does contain information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches, ASIC would have power to pass on that material to the AFP.

Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee ""would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost ."" (Emphasis added.) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.221,0.051,0.729,0.9984,6.3274
Case891,Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134,"If, however, ASIC meant to submit not that it could compel a person (here, an employee or former employee) to disclose a third party's (here, a company's) privilege by force of statute, but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party's privilege, then that contention may be accepted. Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder). To put it another way, the ASIC investigator was legally correct when he told counsel for AWB that ""[n]either ... could [the employees] make the claim [of privilege on behalf of AWB] nor [could they] waive the claim..."": [12] above. 30 That conclusion sounds, at least at first blush, as harsh or unjust. Even Mason J, in holding that an employee could not claim privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of his or her corporate employer in order to resist a subpoena, accepted that ( Rochfort at 145): To acknowledge that the employee's possession [of privileged information] is sufficient in itself to sustain an obligation to produce, without reference to his employer, would be to disregard the employer's rights with respect to his documents. What is more it would deprive him of the privilege of objecting to produce a document on the ground that it has a tendency to incriminate him. However, closer examination reveals both why this result is not as harsh as it first seems and why it is necessary. 31 First, although the examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act is private, it is an examination where ""the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it, or during a part of it"": s 22(1). If a direction is made for a person to attend, that person is entitled to attend the examination: s 22(2). The ""person"" referred to in s 22 is not the examinee's lawyer. The right of the examinee's lawyer to attend and address the inspector is separately and expressly provided for in s 23. Who then could that person be? One obvious contender is the legal adviser of the examinee's employer in circumstances such as those outlined in the extracts of the transcript (see [10] above). But ASIC did not permit that to occur. The power to make directions must include directions not only about the identity of the legal representative who might be entitled to attend on behalf of the company at any examination, but also about the non-disclosure of the contents of the examination to any person or entity (including the entity seeking to protect its privileged communications). 32 Of course, there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer's privilege. There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation: see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at [35] , [38]; see also Rochfort at 145 (Mason J) (stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but ""the protection of the employer's interests [in the information] must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two""). But in the absence of such a circumstance, the voluntary grant by ASIC of a limited right to be present in the manner outlined by counsel for AWB might have forestalled the issues raised in these proceedings. 36 I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests). In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt.

Case894,SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162,"On 19 April 2004, I gave directions in the proceeding, including a direction that the applicant file and serve any amended application, with proper particulars of the grounds relied upon. I also granted a certificate pursuant to O 80 of the Federal Court Rules , so that the applicant could receive legal advice from a barrister. Counsel who ultimately appeared for the applicant accepted the referral. An amended draft order nisi was filed, in which prohibition was sought against the Minister, and certiorari and mandamus against the Tribunal, although the Tribunal was still not named as a respondent to the proceeding. Remedies cannot be sought against the Tribunal unless it is named as a respondent, so it will be necessary for me to make orders adding the Tribunal as a respondent, with consequential amendments to the documents filed. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 . 6 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act '), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms 'Refugees Convention' and 'Refugees Protocol' are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967. It is convenient to call these two instruments, taken together, the 'Convention'. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 'owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country'. 7 Section 91R of the Migration Act provides relevantly as follows: '(1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article unless: ... (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and ... (2) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes of that paragraph: (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; (b) significant physical harassment of the person; (c) significant physical ill-treatment of the person; (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.044,0.072,0.884,-0.946,-0.2829999999999999
Case895,Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641,"Counsel for the Minister argued that, at least as to part of the relief claimed, the application was out of time under the High Court Rules 1952 ('the High Court rules') and, unless the Court extended the time, that relief could not be granted. As I have said, the relief sought against the Minister is prohibition. The High Court Rules contained no time limit in respect of an application for prohibition. Counsel for the Minister contended that it was inappropriate to seek prohibition against the Minister; once the Tribunal decision has been made, if it is not set aside, the Minister has a statutory obligation to remove the applicant from Australia. While this argument may be correct, it is of no consequence in the present case. It is conceded that, as against the Tribunal, the remedy of certiorari was sought by the filing of the application in the High Court within the time limit then fixed by O 55 r 17(1) of the High Court Rules. The application to the High Court was not filed within the two-month time limit, fixed by O 55 r 30 of the High Court Rules, in respect of an application for mandamus. In Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 at [73] , after examining some of the authorities, I expressed the conclusion that the better view is that, once the High Court has remitted an application for an order nisi to this Court, the time limits applicable in that court are no longer of any consequence. I remain of that opinion. 22 In any event, there was an amended draft order nisi filed in this Court. Although the use of an amended draft order nisi was perhaps not the most convenient procedure, it was of itself sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, conferred by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , afresh. On the assumption that the Tribunal's decision is affected by jurisdictional error, and is consequently not 'a decision...made...under this Act' for the purposes of the definition of 'privative clause decision' in s 474(2) of the Migration Act , the time limit then fixed by s 477(1) was inapplicable. On that assumption, there was no time limit fixed for invoking the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 39B of the Judiciary Act , in respect of the Tribunal's decision. See Applicants M16 at [74]. 23 If it were necessary to enlarge the time limit for the application for mandamus, to give the applicant a constitutional entitlement to seek certiorari as an adjunct to mandamus (certiorari being a remedy not mentioned in s 75(v) of the Constitution ), then I should not hesitate to do so in the present case. There has been no undue delay. The proceeding was commenced within the time limited for an application for certiorari. The delay is not, in any event, gross. The Minister has not claimed to have suffered any prejudice by reason of the delay. The applicant's claim is one that has merits. 24 An alternative view is that certiorari might be a remedy available to the applicant, pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), in a proceeding in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked validly by the remittal by the High Court of the application for prohibition against the Minister, even if the applicant could not succeed in obtaining that remedy against that respondent. 25 For all these reasons, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of the time of the commencement of the proceeding any further. 26 The applicant's case included a number of facts which, if accepted, distinguished him from most, if not all, of the people dealt with by the Egyptian authorities as a result of the activities at the nightclub. At the time of the events, the applicant was not a teenager, but was in his mid-twenties. He was not merely attending the events at which what were regarded as satanic rituals were taking place, but was facilitating those events, by making videotapes, and ensuring that the memory of the events was kept alive, by selling the videotapes to the participants. It was perhaps true to say, as the Tribunal did, that he was not an 'organiser' of the events, but he was certainly not in the same category as the ordinary participants.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.045,0.038,0.917,0.8579,5.99565
Case896,Award Simplification Case (1997) 75 IR 272,"Counsel also argued that I should look at the earlier award in 1965 which was ""simplified"": see Award Simplification Case (1997) 75 IR 272.

These indicate that O 15A r 6 is to be beneficially construed and given the fullest scope that its language will reasonably allow, with the proper brake on any excesses lying in the discretion of the Court in the light of the specific circumstances. Each of the elements in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) of r 6 must be established. The test for determining whether the applicant has ""reasonable cause to believe"" as required by r 6(a) is an objective one. There is no requirement for the applicant to make out a prima facie case, but a mere assertion that there may be a right to obtain relief is not sufficient. There must be more than suspicion or conjecture. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application in so far as it is based on that cause of action. 15 In relation to r 6(b), the authorities indicate that the question is whether an applicant has sufficient information for the limited purpose of making a decision as to whether to commence proceedings in the Court. It is permissible for an applicant to obtain discovery to determine what defences are available to the respondent, and the possible strength of these defences, but discovery is not available to an applicant so that it may exhaust every possible line of defence.

No doubt inspection of the documents referred to in Alphapharm's application would assist it in taking that decision, but I am of the view that it already has reasonably sufficient information to enable it to decide. Another way of expressing the matter is to say that Alphapharm has not, after making all reasonable inquiries, come up against an obstacle consisting of the lack of key information which it reasonably needs to enable it to decide whether to commence a proceeding; rather, it hopes to be comforted in taking the decision which it already has sufficient information to enable it to take .'

Case906,C7 Pty Limited v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864,"These remarks, particularly at [50], are apposite to the present case. It is necessary for an applicant to show more than a mere assertion that there is a case against a prospective respondent: see C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [39] . The purpose of preliminary discovery is not to produce material which will strengthen or enhance a decision to commence proceedings but rather to provide what is reasonably necessary to enable the decision to be made. 20 The respondents resist the application and submit that the application must fail because essential elements which must be established under r 6(a) to (c) in order to found jurisdiction in the Federal Court have not been made out. In addition, the respondents submit that as a matter of discretion, the Court should refuse to grant the discovery sought on the basis that it is oppressive and so broadly cast as to encompass what are likely to be a substantial number of irrelevant documents. 21 In relation to r 6(a), the respondents submit that, objectively approached, there is no reasonable cause to believe that the applicant may have a right to obtain relief in the Federal Court. This is because the elements of the prospective cause of action advanced by the applicants which might attract federal jurisdiction, namely, a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), are not present on the evidence. It is said that as an objective conclusion, it has not been established that the elements of such an action can be made out. For present purposes the respondents do not dispute that there may be a cause of action in contract, but say this is not sufficient to ground jurisdiction for the grant of preliminary discovery because it lacks the necessary federal element to satisfy r 6(a) so that there is a right to relief in the Federal Court.

Case910,Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589,"The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, SZFMW v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1274 , in which Driver FM dismissed his application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') handed down on 11 December 2003 ('the Tribunal decision') on the basis of Anshun estoppel. The Federal Magistrate's orders were interlocutory (rule 44.12(2) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth)). The applicant therefore requires leave to appeal to this Court (ss 24(1)(d) and 24 (1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)). The first respondent opposes the application on the basis that Driver FM's judgment is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant leave to appeal being granted and no substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted. 6 His Honour said that, while the issue was not raised in the earlier court proceedings, the principle of res judicata would still probably apply and that, even if it did not, there was no reason why the issue could not have been raised in the earlier legal proceedings. His Honour said that the applicant was simply seeking to take advantage of a recent Court decision that appeared to favour an argument that could have been raised previously. In his Honour's view, the circumstances gave rise to an estoppel in accordance with the principles in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 and Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 51 ; (2004) 146 FCR 10. His Honour said at [5]: ' Applicants cannot continue to agitate concluded litigation when new court decisions are made that appear to be to their advantage ' and dismissed the application. 11 The applicant, who appears in person assisted by an interpreter, was unable to point to any error in Driver FM's decision to dismiss the application on the basis of Anshun estoppel. He reiterates the difficulties with his previous legal representatives and relies upon his lack of appreciation of what could have been advanced before Smith FM. 12 There is no evidence of whether the applicant or his legal advisers were or were not aware of the possibility of reliance upon s 441G of the Act at any time prior to the decision of SZIZO . Even if that section could apply in the present case, a later change to the law does not affect the fact that no jurisdictional error was found in the Tribunal's decision. In Wong the Full Court of the Federal Court applied Anshun in the context of judicial review of administrative action. The Full Court stated at [37] that: In essence, where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceeding between the parties.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.082,0.057,0.861,0.927,6.219500000000001

He points out that s 441A(4)(c)(ii) of the Act provides that the Tribunal may give a document to a person by posting it to the last residential or business address provided by the recipient in connection with the review. The Minister says that the postal address disclosed in correspondence satisfies the requirements of that section. On that basis no breach of s 441G of the Act could be made out as the Tribunal sent the correspondence to the authorised recipient at the postal address disclosed in correspondence between the authorised recipient and the Tribunal in respect of the review of the applicant's application.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.064,0.069,0.867,-0.0588,2.7992

Case915,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190,"In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at 1196, para 18, in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, the following passage appears: if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting ""information"" within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 424A (1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the Appellant's evidence failed to disclose a convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute ""information."" Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 that: The word ""information"" does not encompass the tribunal's objective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identify gaps, defects or lack or detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc. 9 And then the High Court continued: If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons, but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly ""information"" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. 10 There is both an evidentiary as well as a legal characterisation question involved in an allegation that s 424A has been breached. For present purposes, the evidentiary element is resolved against the Appellant in the sense that it is patent that the Tribunal sent to him a letter dated 3 August 2007, which at least purported to comply with the obligation the Tribunal apprehended it had under s 424A. When one examines the terms of that letter as a matter of legal characterisation, it is apparent that the Tribunal has complied with, and perhaps even exceeded, the obligations which fell on it pursuant to s 424A , having regard to what was said by the High Court in SZBYR . 11 The Tribunal has, at some length in the letter, highlighted particular inconsistencies, which it apprehended, having regard to statements made by the Appellant, either to the Department or in evidence at the hearing the Tribunal conducted. Having so done, the Tribunal, in its letter of 3 August 2007, stated that: The inconsistent statements are relevant to the review, as they indicate that you may not be a truthful witness, and that you may have not told the truth in the information provided to, and the statements made to, the Department and to the Tribunal in support of your protection visa application. 12 The Tribunal then, in its letter, invited the Appellant to give comments in writing on the information it had set out in the letter. The Appellant did not respond to this invitation. The learned Federal Magistrate concluded that in the circumstances, there had been no breach by the Tribunal of s 424A. His Honour noted that, at para 83 of the Tribunal's reasons, the Tribunal had come to a conclusion that the Appellant was not a truthful witness. His Honour made reference (at para 15) to a portion of the Full Court's reasons for judgment in VAF , quoted by the High Court in SZBYR , a passage I have already cited. I respectfully agree with the learned Federal Magistrate that no breach of s 424A is evident.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.057,0.045,0.898,0.8827,6.077450000000001
Case916,NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264,"When asked to elaborate upon this ground in oral submissions, the Appellant replied, ""no comment"". Again though, out of considerations of fairness and humanity, it seems to me that with an appellant whose primary language is not English and for whom these processes must seem quite strange, it seems to be preferable to consider this ground on its merits, rather than to treat it in light of the oral submission made as having been abandoned. One finds in the Federal Magistrate's decision at para 17 what in my respectful opinion is an apt summary of principle pertinent to this ground of appeal as given by Moore, Tamberlin and Allsop JJ in NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 at para 115: By and large fact finding is a task within jurisdiction, though factual error is not necessarily mutually exclusive of jurisdictional error Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ex parte Applicant S20 of 2002 198 ALR 9 where fact finding has been conducted in a manner which can be described as here as in substantial respects unreasoned and mere assertion lacking rational or reasoned foundation at times is plainly and ex facie wrong and is selective of material going one way. These conclusions may found a conclusion that the posited fair-minded observer might or indeed would, reasonably apprehend that the conclusions had been reached with a mind not open to persuasion and unable or unwilling to evaluate all the material fairly. How else the fair-minded observer might ask can one explain the largely unreasoned rejection of documents as vague when they plainly were not and it's not saying the appellants were Catholics when expressly or impliedly they did. And how else does one explain not dealing with answers which revealed an apparently detailed knowledge of the Christian religion and the Christian faith when a conclusion is drawn that persons are not Christian based on weighing some answers to questions of less than central importance. The answers to these questions might be that the tribunal lacked an appreciation of the need to weigh all the material. If that were the case, it would itself support a conclusion of jurisdictional error. The answer might also be the lack of an ability or willingness to deal with the material before it with a mind open to persuasion barely evaluating all the material. 14 One sees in the Tribunal's reasons a very comprehensive rehearsal indeed of the basis upon which the Appellant sought a protection visa and of the various statements which he had made both to the department and later to the Tribunal. Having so done, under the heading ""Findings and Reasons"", one finds in the Tribunal's reasons what seems to me, as it seemed to the Federal Magistrate, a logical and reasoned analysis of the ramifications of particular inconsistencies there detailed by the Tribunal. That analysis culminates in the following paragraphs in the Tribunal's reasons which capture not only the bases of the Appellant's claim for a protection visa but also why the Tribunal concludes that the claim lacks a factual foundation: [83] On the above evidence and for the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a truthful witness and his statements, both to the Department and the Tribunal, lack credibility. Also for the above reasons, and as the Tribunal has found that the applicant is not credible, the Tribunal also finds that the applicant: was not a member of an underground church, was not involved with Mr Lin in religious activities, was not involved with a Mr Lin, who was or was claimed to be Taiwanese spy by Chinese authorities, did not provide ""waste paper"" with government stamps to Mr Lin, was not warned by Chinese authorities to not go to bible study meetings, was not advised by Chinese authorities to attend ""big church"", was not arrested in August 2006, his shop was not searched and closed by police at the end of October 2006, and he did not go into hiding at the end of 2006. 15 Having made these findings, the Tribunal then found: [84] Although the applicant has knowledge of Christianity and may be a Christian, the Tribunal finds that he would not be persecuted in the reasonable foreseeable future if he returns to the Peoples Republic of China for his religious or imputed religious beliefs, as the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a member of an underground church. Further, for similar reasons, the Tribunal finds that the applicant would not be persecuted in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to the Peoples Republic of China, his opinion or imputed political opinion, as the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant was involved with Mr Lin, who was or was claimed to be a Taiwanese spy by Chinese authorities or he provided ""waste paper"" with government stamps to Mr Lin. 18 In SZKLK v Minister For Immigration [2008] FCA 1125 , I had occasion to review various authorities touching upon the administrative law error ground of bias. I shall not repeat what is there stated. One way in which a claim for bias might be made out, in a way which intersects with unreasonableness, is that stated in the passage which I have quoted from in NADH of 2001 . That basis is not made out here. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal are objectively able to be seen as referable to logical consequences of credibility findings reasonably open to the Tribunal. There is not a scintilla of evidence which would support a conclusion of actual bias on the part of the Tribunal. However one approaches the case, the result is nothing more than a consequence of conclusions the Tribunal reached in light of inconsistencies that it found. That result is undoubtedly disappointing to the Appellant, but again, I remind myself that it is no part of my role to descend into the merits of whether the claim should be accepted.

It is not the role of the Federal Magistrates Court, and much less is it the role of this Court, to make value judgments as to the factual merits of a claim for a protection visa, or in respect of the credibility of the applicant for such a visa. A principled restraint is called for on the part of those exercising judicial power in relation to such matters in these types of cases. Credibility findings are, in the ordinary course, findings of fact par excellence: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405. 17 Again, it is evident from the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that his Honour adopted just such an approach. Further, like his Honour, I do not apprehend from the Tribunal's reasons any error on its part in applying the so-called ""real chance"" test. In this regard, it suffices for me to endorse, respectfully, the observations made by the learned Federal Magistrate at para 20 of his reasons for judgment.

In that case, the Full Court construed s 91R(3) as capable of sensible application, only once primary findings of fact have been made. In other words, conduct must first be shown to have taken place before it could be disregarded. It is evident from the passage which I have quoted from the Tribunal's reasons that conduct, namely attendance at church in Australia, was found. The Tribunal was entitled to make the finding that it did concerning the motivation for that attendance. 21 Further, the Tribunal was obliged, having made its findings, to disregard the attendance, and whatever ramifications it may have had in relation to a claim for a protection visa, in light of s 91R(3).

Case920,Nathan v Capital Finance Australian Ltd [2007] FMCA 1503,"appellant, Mr Kailai Nathan, appeals from a judgment of Burchardt FM, in which his Honour dismissed Mr Nathan's claims concerning alleged contraventions of ss 52 and 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (""the Act ""); see Nathan v Capital Finance Australia Ltd [2007] FMCA 1503. Mr Nathan's amended statement of claim in the proceeding below traversed many issues, however his Honour struck out all aspects of it other than those concerning ss 52 and 60 of the Act . In his reasons for judgment, Burchardt FM said at [10]: ""I did ... make it clear that the trial would be restricted to the issues involving alleged contraventions of s 52 and s 60 of the Act ."" The aspects of the amended statement of claim dealing with other issues were the subject of interlocutory decisions of the primary judge in respect of which Mr Nathan did not seek leave to appeal. The events the subject of the claim under s 52 of the Act occurred in May 2001. Mr Nathan's case was essentially as follows: &#8226; on 24 May 2001 he visited the premises of James Lane Motors in Coburg; &#8226; at that time he was employed as a casual psychiatric nurse by a nursing agency; &#8226; he spoke to a Mr Gavin Fernandez at James Lane Motors about purchasing a motor vehicle; &#8226; on 28 May 2001, he returned to James Lane Motors and spoke to a Mr Cameron McCredie; and &#8226; Mr McCredie told him that the loan arrangement for the purchase of the vehicle included ""loan protection cover"" for the monthly payments. The respondent's case on the s 52 issue was essentially as follows: &#8226; Mr Nathan might be confused about loan protection insurance on the car because he had taken out a personal loan with the respondent in September 2001 which included a sickness, accidental injury or involuntary unemployment insurance policy, as part of that personal loan; &#8226; no such loan protection cover was included in the car loan or any representation made to that effect; &#8226; it is not possible to obtain such insurance cover in favour of a debtor; and &#8226; if such a representation was made by Mr McCredie, he was not authorised to do so by the respondent.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.047,0.04,0.912,0.5924,5.063400000000001
Case922,Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118,"findings of fact, referred to above, on the s 52 issue were strong and decisive ones, aided by the primary judge's observations of the evidence given by Mr Nathan and by Mr McCredie. Grounds one, three and seven of the notice of appeal dealing with the s 52 issue challenge certain findings of fact made by the primary judge. Those findings include his Honour's categorisation of Mr Nathan as an unimpressive witness with a propensity not to tell the truth. Those are not matters on which this Court is any better placed than the court below to assess, nor is a review of the factual findings the Federal Magistrate made a proper exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court; see Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 125-126 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The only substantive legal challenge to the s 52 aspect of the case as dealt with below is the allegation in ground two of the notice of appeal that Mr Nathan was denied natural justice by his Honour's alleged failure to give proper effect to s 52. That ground is related to ground eight which alleges that the primary judge failed to consider whether the alleged representation induced Mr Nathan into error. Those grounds are untenable. Section 52 precludes a corporation, in trade or commerce, from engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. His Honour found that no such conduct occurred. That finding was open to him on the evidence before him. No appealable error has been identified on this aspect of the appeal. Ground five of the notice of appeal contains the allegation that the primary judge erred in his approach to the allegations of harassment and coercion made under s 60 of the Act . Section 60 of the Act provides: A corporation shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer . On the topic of the alleged breach of s 60 by the respondent, the primary judge said at [69]: It only remains now to deal with the issue of harassment asserted by Mr Nathan. The endeavours made by the Respondent to repossess the car and to otherwise pursue legal avenues against Mr Nathan were all, in my view, entirely reasonable and do not begin to approach what might be said to be harassment within the meaning of s 60 of the Act .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.068,0.083,0.849,-0.8783,-0.05905000000000005
Case923,O'Sullivan v Parkin [2007] FCAFC 98,"the primary judge published his reasons for judgment on 10 September 2007 he did not make any orders.

No orders were made until 18 September 2007 when his Honour dismissed the application and ordered costs against Mr Nathan on an indemnity basis. Mr Nathan has not sought to appeal from the judgment which contained the operative orders in respect of which he seeks relief. However, despite this, I have dealt with his appeal as if the judgment of 10 September 2007 contained an order dismissing his application. This is the most practical commonsense way of dealing with the controversy between the parties, especially as Mr Nathan does not have the benefit of legal representation. It is also necessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal enumerated in Mr Nathan's notice of appeal. Ground four contains a new allegation of bias against the primary judge and has not been substantiated by Mr Nathan. The allegation concerned a disclosure made by his Honour of a shareholding in the parent company of the respondent. Mr Nathan conceded that he did not raise any issue of bias at the time his Honour made the disclosure and therefore acquiesced in his Honour hearing the application. However, Mr Nathan referred in his oral submissions today to comments made in transcript by the Federal Magistrate at an interlocutory hearing. Those comments showed that the Federal Magistrate was keen to bring the proceeding to finality. That does not mean that he was biased in any way against Mr Nathan or that there exists any basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias against his Honour. Ground six is: ""Did the learned Federal Magistrate err in law in assuming the terms of the Loan Protection insurance in the absence of the policy itself..."". This ground is based on an incorrect premise that the primary judge assumed the terms of an agreement when it was proved that no such agreement existed. That ground also fails. The Court will order as follows: 1. The appeal is dismissed. 2. The appellant pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.

Once the Tribunal was unable to find that she had been arrested as claimed, her further claims of detention and rape became logically irrelevant. The Tribunal, having found that it could not rely on her evidence of arrest, was not then required to act on her allegations of detention and rape, allegations which were dependent on her claim of being arrested and taken into custody for reasons of political opinion. The Tribunal was not bound therefore to make any express finding as to whether she had been raped. Nor given the nature of her claim and the Tribunal's finding that she was not a credible witness was it required, as it might have been in other circumstances, to determine whether there was a real chance that she had been arrested as she claimed.""

Case926,AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533,"is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court: AZAAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship &amp; Another [2008] FMCA 1533. On 14 November 2008, that Court made an order that the appellant's application for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") be dismissed. The appellant is a national of Egypt. He arrived in Australia on a student visa on 10 May 2005, having left Cairo on 9 May 2005. On 23 June 2005, the appellant made an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa (""protection visa""). On 30 September 2005, a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused the appellant's application for a protection visa. On 2 November 2005, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision. On 28 January 2006, the Tribunal decided to affirm the delegate's decision not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal. By consent, the Federal Magistrates Court issued constitutional writs setting aside the Tribunal's decision and it remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law. On 5 February 2008, the Tribunal (differently constituted) once again decided to affirm the decision of the delegate not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. The appellant again made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal and it is the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court on that application which is the subject of the appeal to this Court.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.02,0.023,0.957,-0.2547,2.1115500000000003
Case927,Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389,"appellant submits that the approach of the Tribunal member involved jurisdictional error and that the federal magistrate erred in law in failing to so conclude. He referred to the well-known passage in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 ("" Dranichnikov "") (at 394 [26]): ""At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the tribunal involves a number of steps. First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."" The appellant submits that the Tribunal member failed to determine at the outset whether the following particular social groups, or one of them, existed for the purposes of the Convention: (a) a family of Coptic Christians with prominent members that proselytise Muslims in Egypt; and (b) Coptic Christian proselytisers of Muslims in Egypt. The Tribunal member rejected the suggestion that merely being a Coptic Christian could give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution and, as I understand it, it is not suggested that jurisdictional error arose in relation to that conclusion. The Tribunal member reached the same conclusion after he added to the appellant's status as a Coptic Christian the activities of his grandfather and uncle. The Tribunal member also rejected the appellant's account of his proselytising activities. As the Tribunal member said, he rejected ""various constituent details of [the appellant's] account"" and he was not satisfied that the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community. As far as the two particular social groups set out in [45] above and on the assumption in relation to the group identified in (a) that the appellant is one of the prominent proselytisers, the Tribunal member approached the matter by going straight to the second question, namely, whether the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. He found that he was not. In those circumstances, it was not necessary for the Tribunal member to formulate and consider a precise social group because an element of each formulation is that the appellant was a proselytiser of Muslims. The Tribunal member did make a reference to whether proselytisers of Muslims in local Christian communities could face persecution by reason of those activities, but he did not directly address the first question identified by Gummow and Callinan JJ in Dranichnikov . Nevertheless, for the reasons I have given, that did not lead to jurisdictional error. It is not clear to me whether the appellant is submitting that the Tribunal member failed to address, as an alternative to his principal claim, a claim that he feared persecution not as a result of his own activities, but as a result of his membership of his family and the activities of his grandfather and uncle. If he is making that submission, I would reject it because I think the Tribunal did address that possibility. The appellant's own claim that his problems did not begin until 2003-2004 meant either that his family was not a relevant particular social group or, in the circumstances, membership of it did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. The second ground of appeal is linked to the first. It is that the federal magistrate erred in not concluding that the Tribunal member erred by addressing the wrong question in that the Tribunal member concluded that the appellant had not been drawn into the conflict involving his uncle and that he was not significantly affected by his grandfather's situation or his uncle's situation. I do not think the Tribunal member erred in approaching the matter in that way. He was saying no more than that the appellant's membership of his family, which included his grandfather and uncle, did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. That was a finding open to the Tribunal member on the evidence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.028,0.084,0.888,-0.9935,-0.4212500000000001
Case928,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559,"what if I am wrong test was discussed by Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 576. ""It is true that, in determining whether there is a real chance that an event will occur or will occur for a particular reason, the degree of probability that similar events have or have not occurred or have or have not occurred for particular reasons in the past is relevant in determining the chance that the event or the reason will occur in the future. If, for example, a Tribunal finds that it is only slightly more probable than not that an applicant has not been punished for a Convention reason, it must take into account the chance that the applicant was so punished when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of future persecution. In the present case, however, the Tribunal appears to have had no real doubt that its findings both as to the past and the future were correct. That is, the Tribunal appears to have taken the view that the probability of error in its findings was insignificant. Once the Tribunal reached that conclusion, a finding that nevertheless Mr Guo had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason would have been irrational. Given its apparent confidence in its conclusions, the Tribunal was not then bound to consider whether its findings might be wrong."" In Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J said (544-545 [83]-[85]): ""As Guo makes clear, even if the Tribunal is not affirmatively satisfied that the events deposed to by an applicant have occurred, the degree of probability of their occurrence or non-occurrence is a relevant matter in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution.

Case929,N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21,"refer also to N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21 at 34-35 [43]-[49]. In my opinion, there are two answers to the appellant's submission. The first is that the Tribunal member did not, it seems to me, have any real doubt about his conclusions. He found that, even making allowance for the appellant's medical condition, he was not a witness of truth. He made the point on a number of occasions in the course of his reasons that he did not believe the appellant's account of events and that he found particular claims made by the appellant to be inconsistent and implausible. The second answer to the appellant's submission is that the Tribunal member did address the ultimate questions of whether the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community and whether he faced a real chance of persecution in Egypt (see [19] and [22]). The second submission in relation to grounds three and four is that it is said that the Tribunal member's reasoning in the following passage is illogical: ""The Tribunal accepts as genuine the death certificate pertaining to the Applicant's father. The Tribunal accepts that the Applicant's father died at home at 49 years from a 'brain haemorrhage' or stroke. The Tribunal is prepared to accept in principle that a person could die hours after a serious beating from internal bleeding, for example, in the head or in the torso. On the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not accept the claim that the Applicant's father died as a result of police brutality or that he was detained and mistreated by the police shortly before dying. On the evidence before the Tribunal, the claimed circumstances of the Applicant's father's death are concocted. This is to a significant extent because the Tribunal does not accept as factual the key events that led to the Applicant going into internal exile, or the circumstances in which he returned to the farm, or the facts about how he obtained his passport. The Tribunal does not accept the Applicant's claim that the authorities adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating his father to get to or at him, the Applicant, or to extract information about him. The Tribunal also finds that in view of the Applicant's overall credibility problems up to this point, it does not accept that the authorities, supposedly acting in the interests of violently angered fundamentalists, adopted a stance or pattern of detaining and beating the Applicant's father to punish him for his own actions or to deter him from similar actions in the future.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.041,0.13,0.829,-0.993,-0.38649999999999984
Case930,NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264,"connection with this submission, reference was made to NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 ; (2004) 214 ALR 264 ("" NADH "") and, in particular, to Allsop J (with whom Moore and Tamberlin JJ agreed) at 286-287 [129]-[136]. I do not think that there is anything illogical in the Tribunal member's reasoning. In essence, the conclusion is reached that the story is concocted by the appellant because key elements of his account cannot be accepted. The fifth ground of appeal is not pressed by the appellant. Secondly, the appellant submitted that the conduct of the review and the findings made by the Tribunal member should lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. The appellant referred to NADH at 266-285 [10]-[125], a case in which the Full Court of this Court held that the Tribunal was guilty of apprehended bias. A singular feature of that case was that a number of letters and documents were in effect put to one side by the Tribunal member as not establishing any fact without any real reasons being given for adopting that course. For example, a number of letters were dismissed by the Tribunal member as being of no weight on the grounds that they were vague or did not establish certain matters without any real reasons being given for those conclusions.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.036,0.069,0.895,-0.7067,0.5595500000000002

The reason was that ratification by Australia of an international convention engendered a ""legitimate expectation"" that administrative decision makers would act in conformity with that convention. Mr Karp has drawn attention to the fact that the expression has perhaps fallen into disuse since Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 , see especially at [61]-[64] and [81]-[83] per McHugh and Gummow JJ, [121] per Hayne J, [148] per Callinan J. In view of the way in which the present case was argued, I need say no more of this. Quite apart from Teoh , the Direction provided a basis for a legitimate expectation that the Minister would treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration when deciding whether to cancel Mr Rinka's visa. This expectation was created by the fact that the letter of 20 February 2006 notifying Mr Rinka of the Minister's intention to consider cancelling his visa stated that the decision-maker would have regard to the Direction in coming to a decision. I will first address the question whether the best interests of Mr Rinka's children were in fact treated as a primary consideration by the Minister. Briefing Paper The briefing paper to the Minister, headed ""Issues for Consideration of Possible Cancellation of a Visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 "", was structured by reference to the Direction. Since it was plain that Mr Rinka failed to pass the character test, there was little discussion of that matter. The Minister's ""Discretion"" was considered under the headings ""Primary Considerations"", ""Other Considerations"" and ""Other International Obligations"". Three Primary Considerations were discussed: ""Protection of the Australian Community"", ""The Expectations of the Australian Community"" and ""The Best Interests of the Child"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.068,0.04,0.893,0.9062,6.146700000000001

Case935,Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133,"Rinka submits that the Minister failed to identify what the best interests of the children indicated she should decide with respect to the cancellation of Mr Rinka's visa, and that the Minister therefore did not treat the best interests of the children as a primary consideration in reaching her decision. In making these submission, Mr Rinka relies on Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 568 ; (2001) 107 FCR 133 ( Wan ) (see, particularly, [26]-[27], [31]). Mr Rinka submits that the concept of the best interests of the children involved consideration of their relationship with Mr Rinka. He submits that the Minister had before her the older son's letter saying that he misses his father and speaking of his exploits at soccer, yet she did not refer to this material in her statement of reasons. Counsel for Mr Rinka accepts that this alone does not show jurisdictional error, but submits that, in combination with the ""speculative"" comments made by the Minister in para 81 of her statement of reasons, it does suggest that she did not give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the material that was before her. If she did not, it would follow that the best interests of the children also could not have been given proper, genuine and realistic consideration. Consideration Wan , on which Mr Rinka relied, concerned an appeal to the Court from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse to grant a permanent residence (general-spouse) visa on character grounds. It was also a ""best interests of the child"" case. There were provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) governing the procedure of the AAT that have no relevance in the circumstances of the present case. Nonetheless, the Full Court's holding in Wan that in order to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration, a decision maker must identify what those interests indicate the decision should be, is applicable. The Full Court held that the AAT did not do so. An alternative ground for the Full Court's decision was that the conclusion was inescapable that the AAT had not treated the best interests of the child as ""a primary consideration"". As indicated earlier, although the Minister's statement of reasons does not say in terms that ""the best interests"" of Mr Rinka's children dictated that his visa not be cancelled, that is the effect of para 83. Moreover, the Minister did say that she was treating the best interests of Mr Rinka's children as a primary consideration, and it is not shown that her statement to that effect should not be accepted. In the result, in my opinion the Minister's statement of reasons shows that the Minister treated the best interests of Mr Rinka's two children as a primary consideration, as she said she did in the first sentence of para 80.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.149,0.041,0.809,0.9957,6.373950000000001
Case936,Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 201,"On 26 February 2007 I made orders in the following terms: 1. The applicant is to file and serve a substituted statement of claim on or before 26 March 2007. 2. The respondents are at liberty to provide to the applicant on or before 12 March 2007 information by way of letter or disclosure of documents or by an affidavit sworn by their solicitor upon instructions, setting out: (i) their respective functions as members of the Hog's Breath group of companies in Australia; (ii) their respective roles in the use of the Hog's Breath Works as defined in the statement of claim and/or the registered trade marks referred to in the statement of claim; (iii) the ways in which the Hog's Breath Works and/or the registered trade marks have been used by them in respect of the classes of goods and services to which they relate. I also made orders relating to the costs of the respondents' strike out motion and adjourned the directions hearing to 11 April 2007: Lamb v Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 201. 4 In argument prior to the delivery of that judgment counsel for Mr Lamb said that he did not have a clear picture of the respective functions of the respondent companies within the Hog's Breath group. In the original statement of claim it was said that HB Investments Pty Limited (HB Investments) held registered trade marks and that the principal case against it was that it had authorised infringement of Mr Lamb's copyright in the Wave Hog Work by licensing to the other corporate respondents the right to use those trade marks. What trade marks were licensed to which respondents did not appear. A significant obstacle in the way of a more precise pleading on Mr Lamb's part was the absence of information about which of the companies took that role within the Hog's Breath group and which was responsible for the production and marketing of the various articles said to bear infringing productions of the work or of a substantial part thereof. As noted in that judgment want of knowledge does not of itself excuse a pleading which does not identify which cause of action is raised against which respondent or which fails to identify the material facts constituting each such cause of action. Although O 15A of the Federal Court Rules may well have been available to enable Mr Lamb to identify the persons against which he might have a cause of action, or the causes of action he might have, it was not availed of. 5 A substituted statement of claim was filed on 10 April 2007. It was a much more substantial document than its predecessor and was settled by senior counsel. It identifies Hog's Breath Company Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Company) as the master franchisor, since 24 October 2006, of a franchised chain of restaurants around the world known as ""Hog's Breath Cafes"". A list of Australian franchisees is scheduled to the statement of claim. Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia)), the second respondent, is identified as the master franchisee of the Australian franchisees since at least 24 October 2006. HB Investments is said to be the registered owner of Australian registered trade mark numbers 701388 and 1013512, both of which involve the image described, inter alia, as ""Hog, cartoon wears sunglasses &amp; crossed bandages, adhesive on body"". Hog's Breath Clothing Co Pty Ltd (Hog's Breath Clothing) is said to be the owner and operator of a business selling merchandise under the name ""Hog's Breath Clothing"" through a website and through the Australian franchisees. The fifth respondent, Mr Algie, is said to be a director, secretary and majority shareholder of Hog's Breath Company and to have been a director of Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) between September 1995 and April 2000. He is also said to be a director, secretary and majority shareholder of HB Investments and a director, secretary and majority shareholder of Hog's Breath Clothing. 6 Paragraphs 7 to 12 assert subsistence and ownership of copyright in the Wave Hog Work by Mr Lamb. Paragraphs 13 and 14 plead and particularise Mr Algie's access and exposure to the Wave Hog Work and his knowledge that the respondents are not, and have not, been the owners of copyright in that work. It is alleged that the work depicted in Schedule B to the application is a reproduction of the whole or a substantial part of the Wave Hog Work ([15]). Paragraphs 16 to 21 deal with the conduct of the Australian franchisees asserting, inter alia, that they have displayed the infringing work on restaurant signage and on banners and have distributed or offered for sale or exhibited to the public various items depicting that work. These items are set out in a schedule to the substituted statement of claim. 7 The substituted statement of claim then sets out the bases of Mr Lamb's copyright claim against Hog's Breath Company ([22]-[38]), Hog's Breath Cafe (Australia) ([39]-[54] inclusive), HB Investments ([55]-[66] inclusive), Hog's Breath Clothing ([67]-[83] inclusive) and Mr Algie ([84]-[103] inclusive). There are allegations of a common design entered into by the various respondents ([104]) and pleading of facts relied upon to support a claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and conversion damages under s 116(1) of that Act ([105]-[106]). Moral rights claims are also raised against the respondents ([107]-[175]).

His Honour referred to the need to consider all aspects of a matter including both substantive and adjectival matters and concluded by saying: It is not in ""the interests of justice"" to adopt a course, in relation to those matters, which places unnecessary burdens and delays upon the parties to the litigation. These ideas, although not directly applicable, are nevertheless apt to be applied in the present case. In summary, it seems to me, there is in reality no connection at all with New South Wales. There is nothing else which can fairly be weighed in the balance in favour of keeping the proceedings in this Registry of this Court. There are, on the other side of things, substantial reasons based upon the cost and inconvenience to individual litigants which would justify a transfer to the Queensland District Registry of this Court and I propose to make an order accordingly. It seems to me that the applicant was entitled to resist the application in the form in which it was pressed because the primary order sought was an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The third respondent has not persuaded me that such an order should be made. On the other hand, the applicant did resist the making of any orders. In those circumstances each of the relevant parties has experienced some success and some failure. It seems to me that the appropriate order as to the costs of the motion for transfer brought by the third respondent is that those costs be costs in the proceedings.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.119,0.042,0.84,0.9725,6.329750000000001

Case945,Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57,"fundamental objection, however, was that the point had no merit and would not succeed. In my view, the point does have merit, and in the very unusual circumstances of this case, it seems to me that an amendment should be permitted along the lines read onto the record by the solicitor for the appellants. The argument has merit based upon the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57, where in very similar circumstances, (that is, a change of position in the country of origin prior to the decision due to reliance by the delegate on new material and the appellant being given no opportunity to respond), the High Court had no difficulty in finding that there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. The main issue in that case was that by then there had been amendments to the Act which enabled an argument to be put that there was then a code for dealing with the situation and that the ordinary common law natural justice rules did not apply. That argument is not available in this case, because the amendments had not been made, so the common law rules clearly do apply. The answer which is made on behalf of the Minister is that in this case, all the issues raised in the later material to which reference was made by the Tribunal member were traversed in the earlier material and that the late material really amounted to pieces of evidence which were not required to be put forward for particular comment. There is also, I might say, always the argument that it is the visa applicant's case, and if circumstances change in the country of origin, then it is up to the applicant to keep on top of things and keep the Tribunal informed. It seems to me that the approach of the High Court in Miah, and indeed in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, which was applied in Miah , makes this all too plain a case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness.

Case946,Re Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd (1975) 1 ACLR 203,"The question for the court was succinctly stated by Bowen, CJ in Eq in Re Magna Alloys and Research Pty Ltd (1975) 1 ACLR 203 at 205. His Honour noted that an applicant who came seeking relief bore an onus of establishing that the general policy of the legislature laid down in an analogue of section 206B ought be made the subject of an exception in his or case. His Honour continued: 'The court in exercising its discretion will have regard to the nature of the offence of which the applicant has been convicted, the nature of his involvement and the general character of the applicant including his conduct in the intervening period since he was removed from the board and from management. Where, as here, the applicant seeks leave to become a director and to take part in the management of particular companies the court will consider the structure of those companies, the nature of their businesses and the interests of their shareholders, creditors and employees. One matter to be considered will be the assessment of any risks to those persons or to the public which may appear to be involved in the applicants assuming positions on the board or in management' 10 In this case, the two offences I have described appeared to me, as they did to both the applicant and the Chief Judge of the District Court, to differ in character. The offence involving the false statement about the company not being a party to any legal proceedings is one which, in its true context, does not appear to me to involve any serious issue of lack of probity or anything other than a clear and wrong, but, in all the circumstances, unfortunate slip by the applicant in filling in and signing a form on advice. 11 The other conviction, which was the one that attracted the more serious penalty, is of a different order and involved an attempt, on one view, to avoid paying a substantial sum of money due to the State by making a false statement that there were no outstanding liabilities. I have considered the evidence on this matter and the applicant's attitude that he has now clearly set out to resolve this issue and to pay what is due to the State Authorities subject to, what seems to me to be not unreasonable, trying to find from the State Authorities any offsetting amounts that might be due back to Aluform. The evidence before me shows that Mr Lahood has made some considerable efforts to ascertain from the relevant New South Wales Authorities the amount of registration moneys which ought be refunded but has not even received the courtesy of a reply to any of his attempts to find this information out. Hopefully that situation will remedy itself in the period allowed in the proposed orders. 12 I have formed the view that the applicant is genuinely contrite and remorseful for the errors which he committed and recognises that what he did was wrong. It seems to me to be a lapse in an otherwise clean and good record. The applicant has managed these companies with his family for over 20 years. The transport industry is one which is notoriously difficult in economic terms and yet the evidence shows that the companies in the Transtar Group have over 70 employees and also engage something in the order of about 10 contractors. They appear to be otherwise well managed. There are no matters which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('the Commission'), which intervened in the proceedings, was able to bring to attention as to the business practices of the applicant or the Transtar Group which might give any rise to concerns that there was a risk to the public or to those in the companies from the applicant being allowed to be a director, once again, as he seeks. 13 At the conclusion of the oral evidence I inquired of counsel for the Commission whether it was the Commission's position that the disqualification should remain and that there be no leave granted. Counsel, on instructions, said that that was not the Commission's position and that the Commission considered that appropriate conditions could be imposed.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.073,0.071,0.855,0.5041,4.7593499999999995

The principal claims were based on infringement of copyright by a website that facilitated the free downloading of certain sound recordings. The first respondent was the registered owner and operator of the website. It contained hyperlinks to thousands of sound recordings which were located on remote websites and downloaded directly from those websites to the computer of the Internet user. The music file was not sent to, downloaded on, transmitted through or saved to the first respondent's website. The second to fifth respondents hosted the website and were responsible for maintaining the connection to the Internet. They were unaware of the contents of the website and took no steps to inform themselves of that content. Tamberlin J held that the first respondent infringed copyright by authorising the infringing acts of Internet users who accessed the website and the owners or operators of the remote website from which the infringing recordings were downloaded. He permitted and approved the infringements and had sufficient control over his website to prevent the infringements (150 FCR 1 at [77] [102]). The second to fifth respondents infringed the copyright by authorising the infringing acts (150 FCR 1 at [103] [132]). They had an active role in relation to the website, were aware of the content of the website and had the power to prevent the infringing acts.

In that case, the defendants carried on business as an Internet Service Provider and received and stored on their news server an article, defamatory of the plaintiff, which had been posted by an unknown person using another service provider. The plaintiff informed the defendants that the article was defamatory and asked them to remove it from their news server. They failed to do so and it remained available for some 10 days until its automatic expiry. It was held that the defendants were liable at common law as the publisher of the posting they were not merely the passive owner of an electronic device through which postings were transmitted but actively chose to receive and store the news group exchanges containing the posting which could be accessed by their subscribers and could have chosen to obliterate the posting complained of, as they later did. The critical portion of the judgment was as follows ([2001] QB at 208 209): ""In my judgment the defendants, whenever they transmit and whenever there is transmitted from the storage of their news server a defamatory posting, publish that posting to any subscriber to their ISP who accesses the newsgroup containing that posting. Thus every time one of the defendants' customers accesses soc.culture.thai and sees that posting defamatory of the plaintiff there is a publication to that customer. The situation is analogous to that of the bookseller who sells a book defamatory of the plaintiff: see Weldon v 'The Times' Book Co. Ltd (1911) 28 TLR 143 (the case about the books on Gounod); to that of the circulating library who provided books to subscribers: see Vizetelly v Mudie's Select Library Ltd [1900] 2 QB 170 (the case about the book on Stanley's search for Emin Pasha in Africa: see in particular the judgment of Romer LJ pages 178 181); and to that of distributors: see Bottomley v FW Woolworth &amp; Co Ltd (1932) 48 TLR 521 (the case about the article in Detective Story Magazine headed 'Swindlers and Scoundrels. Horatio Bottomley, Editor and Embezzler') and Sun Life Assurance Co of Canada v WH Smith &amp; Son Ltd (1933) 150 LT 211 (the case about newspaper posters announcing 'More grave Sun Life of Canada disclosures'). I do not accept Mr Barca's argument that the defendants were merely owners of an electronic device through which postings were transmitted.

The principal claims were based on infringement of copyright by a website that facilitated the free downloading of certain sound recordings. The first respondent was the registered owner and operator of the website. It contained hyperlinks to thousands of sound recordings which were located on remote websites and downloaded directly from those websites to the computer of the Internet user. The music file was not sent to, downloaded on, transmitted through or saved to the first respondent's website. The second to fifth respondents hosted the website and were responsible for maintaining the connection to the Internet. They were unaware of the contents of the website and took no steps to inform themselves of that content. Tamberlin J held that the first respondent infringed copyright by authorising the infringing acts of Internet users who accessed the website and the owners or operators of the remote website from which the infringing recordings were downloaded. He permitted and approved the infringements and had sufficient control over his website to prevent the infringements (150 FCR 1 at [77] [102]). The second to fifth respondents infringed the copyright by authorising the infringing acts (150 FCR 1 at [103] [132]). They had an active role in relation to the website, were aware of the content of the website and had the power to prevent the infringing acts. Those findings were substantially upheld on appeal, although an employee of the Internet service provider was let out ( Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 particularly per Branson J at [28] [52], [61] [65] and Kenny J at [136] [165]).",Criminal Case,Rape,0.059,0.046,0.895,0.2263,3.7790500000000002

Considerations relevant when deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted are: whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision were wrong. In the present proceeding it is not considered that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attendant with sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted. Nor is it considered that the Applicant would suffer substantial injustice. His application for a protection visa has been considered on its merits by both a delegate of the Minister and by the Tribunal. His application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court has been carefully considered and no legal error discerned. No injustice is exposed in such circumstances. The Federal Magistrate, in his reasons for decision, recounted the facts relevant to the Applicant's claim for a protection visa. Those reasons record that "" [n]o supporting evidence "" for the claims being advanced by the Applicant was provided to the Department and also record the rejection of the claim. Those reasons further record that the Applicant was subsequently invited to attend a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal but that he declined that invitation. Express reference is made by the Federal Magistrate to some of the findings made by that Tribunal. Albeit not set forth expressly in his reason for decision, it is relevant to note that the Tribunal further stated: [36] The applicant did not attend the Tribunal hearing. The applicant only made the briefest of claims. The applicant claims he belongs to a minority group in Pakistan, the 'Mohanjir' community who are Muslims by religion. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to accept that he belongs to the 'Mohanjir' community. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that he and his family have been persecuted by the majority community in Pakistan for several years. ... [37] I am required to consider the situation if the applicant, a Pakistani citizen from Sialkot, were to return to Pakistan now or within a reasonably foreseeable future. ... But the independent evidence before me ... does not suggest that the applicant would not receive the protection of the Pakistani authorities or that such protection would be ineffective, if the applicant were to be harmed. Without further information from the applicant I am unable to be satisfied that if he returns to Pakistan he will be killed, harmed or persecuted for a Convention related reason. The mere fact that a person claims fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish either the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is ""well-founded"" or that it is for the reason claimed. [38] I do not accept there is a real chance the applicant will suffer harm now or in the foreseeable future if he were to return to Pakistan and I am not satisfied the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention related reason. Given the paucity of the material submitted in support of his claim and the paucity of the material apparently available to the Tribunal, and the decision of the now Applicant not to accept the invitation extended to him to attend a hearing before the Tribunal, these conclusions were perhaps not unexpected. The reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate then outline the manner in which he approached his task. The Federal Magistrate observed that "" the applicant's original application made unparticularised contentions of ' gross violations of the Regulations and the Act '..."". An amended application was apparently filed from which the Federal Magistrate discerned "" four essential points "".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.112,0.836,-0.9935,-0.4172500000000001

Leave to appeal is required because the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application before that Court pursuant to Rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth).

(2) To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1) (a) is interlocutory.

This document at [27] advanced the contention that 'Great Bamboo Pty Ltd was not an eligible business because it was not a business in the necessary sense' . In support of this contention it made reference to Mason J's consideration in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 of the meaning of 'business' in a phrase such as 'carrying on a business' . There his Honour stated that in the context of the rating provisions of the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) the phrase 'carrying on a business' denoted activities 'engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis' (at 8-9). The respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal argued that Mr Koosasi's business did not appear 'to have been carried out on an ongoing or repetitive basis' . At [28] the same document advanced the alternative contention that Great Bamboo was not an eligible business because it did not meet any of the requirements listed in the definition of 'eligible business' in s 134(10). In support of this contention the document made reference to the absence of evidence that Mr Koosasi had developed business links with the international market. It also noted that Great Bamboo had not created and was unlikely to create employment, that it had not introduced new or improved technology into Australia nor had it increased commercial activity or competitiveness in the Australian economy. At [39] of its written reasons for decision the Tribunal conflated the two submissions of the respondent identified above, noting: 'The respondent also submits that the business is not an ""eligible"" business as it has only completed four export transactions since its registration in January 2003 and such limited number could not be considered continuing or repetitive ... there is no evidence the company has developed links with international markets; and the company has not created employment; exports of wheat, flour and juice has not introduced any new or improved technology to Australia.'

Case976,AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234,"18 September 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment in this proceeding and adjourned the matter to Monday 25 September 2006 for any argument as to the orders that should be made to give effect to my reasons: AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [251] . These reasons for decision are directed to the final orders that I have determined to make, having heard submissions from the applicant and the respondents yesterday. The issues that separated the parties narrowed considerably during the course of yesterday's hearing. The remaining differences relate to the form of declaratory relief that is appropriate and the costs orders that should be made. AWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents attract privilege, wholly or partly, the Court should make a declaration to that effect. On the other hand, AWB submitted that, where I have determined that documents over which AWB claimed privilege do not attract privilege or that any privilege has been waived, I should not make a declaration to that effect. It submitted that any such declaration was unnecessary and would lack utility. Senior Counsel for AWB said, from the bar table, that the documents in question were being produced to the Commission. The relevance of this is dubious, as it follows the delivery of my reasons for judgment and, presumably, anticipates that final orders will be made that give effect to those reasons. AWB also pointed out that the Commonwealth had not mounted any cross-claim for declaratory relief in its favour.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.127,0.047,0.826,0.9682,6.3087

Case980,Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4,"submitted that the circumstances do not warrant any departure from the usual approach that an applicant who achieves substantial success should have the costs of the proceedings. AWB relied in particular on the following passage from Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 ( 'Cretazzo' ) where Jacobs J said at 16: 'But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case, including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no two cases are alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded, based merely on his success in those particular issues.' In short, AWB submitted that it achieved substantial success and that it should have the costs of the proceeding, notwithstanding its failure on the issues of waiver and the fraud exception. The Commonwealth submitted that AWB should pay its costs of the proceedings. It argued that success in this case cannot be measured purely in numerical terms; rather a judgement ought to be made as to which party has had substantial success in the case, having regard to the significance of the issues decided by the Court in favour of one or other party. It added that a finding that privilege subsists in a large number of technical or peripheral documents cannot be weighed in the same scale. The Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially. The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234. As the passage from Cretazzo indicates, the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant of some or all of its costs. On the other hand, it lies within the Court's discretion to make a costs order that reflects the degree of success attained: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 [11] and 236 [15].

Case988,Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261,"many cases, these principles can only be applied sensibly by taking a broad view of the results of the case and the issues that were litigated. An allocation of costs in a case of mixed results can rarely if ever be done with mathematical precision: Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ. Taking a broad and overall view of the outcome of this case, I consider that both AWB and the Commonwealth achieved a substantial measure of success. I cannot agree with AWB's submission that, in material respects, it was the successful litigant. The Commonwealth succeeded on a number of very important issues. It established that privilege did not attach to numerous documents that are likely to be material to the issues being investigated by the Commission. AWB did not merely fail 'along the way' to prove particular issues of fact and law which, in the end, did not prevent it achieving substantial success; rather, AWB lost some of the most substantial issues that were litigated. Those issues involved more than half of the hearing time occupied by this case. In all the circumstances, I consider that the just and appropriate order is that there be no order as to the costs of the proceeding. The result will be that AWB and the Commonwealth must each bear its own costs. I do not consider that there is any substance in the criticisms that AWB directed towards the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was entitled to put AWB to the proof of its privilege claims. Nor do I agree with AWB's assertion that the description of the documents in AWB's lists was generally sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to form a view about the provenance of each document and the grounds upon which privilege was claimed. AWB also sought the costs of its notice of motion dated 19 June 2006 and the first respondent's notice of motion dated 24 July 2006.

At [10] of the primary judge's reasons in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 on 12 February 2009, the primary judge said this: The evidence lead on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. The focus of the affidavit material which has been read is on dealings as between Neo Rock and the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the context of an as yet unresolved audit of that company's taxation affairs by the ATO. The primary judge noted that the company had engaged a chartered accountant, Mr Vicca, to assist the company with the task of bringing its business activity statements up to date. Mr Vicca expressed certain opinions about the balance debt due to the Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner in response filed affidavit material which suggested that the present indebtedness of the company to the Deputy Commissioner and therefore payable as a debt due to the Commonwealth was $24,132.01. The company contests aspects of that assertion and did so before the primary judge. The primary judge also noted at [13] that the company had failed to lodge income tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The primary judge concluded at [14]: It is not a satisfactory state of affairs for a company, faced with an application for its winding up in respect of a debt which it has not contested in the way provided for when a statutory demand was issued, to seek an indefinite adjournment of a winding up application on the strength of what is, in substance, an assertion unfocussed on the subject of proof of the solvency of the company.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.062,0.884,-0.0026,2.9989000000000003

In Wentworth v Woollahra Municipal Council and Others [1982] HCA 41 ; (1982) 149 CLR 672 at 684 Mason ACJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:- ...the circumstances in which this Court will reopen a judgment which it has pronounced are extremely rare. The public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation necessarily means that the power to reopen to enable a rehearing must be exercised with great caution. Generally speaking, it will not be exercised unless the applicant can show that by accident without fault on his part he has not been heard. Similarly, Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc. and Another v Dyason and Others (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 303 said that the power of the Court to reconsider judgments would not be exercised for the purpose of ' re-agitating arguments already considered by the Court ', nor ' because the party seeking a rehearing has failed to present the argument in all its aspects or as well as it might have been put '. While such authority refers to a basis for reviewing an earlier decision where the Court, still possessing jurisdiction in a proceeding, later considers its decision to be erroneous, this Court considers that the principle referred to in Autodesk and McMullin applies generally and should guide this Court in the present circumstances.

The applicant submits that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A of the Migration Act should be construed narrowly and confined, in accordance with the Second Reading speech of the Act inserting s 261A into the Migration Act , to those cases where forfeiture of the vessel occurs as a penalty in relation to 'people smuggling' criminal offences and not in respect of those instances where persons seek asylum.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.045,0.082,0.873,-0.7783,0.3129499999999994
Case999,Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446,"answer to the applicant's submissions lie the words used in s 261A of the Migration Act . The words providing for the forfeiture are clear and unequivocal. The principles relied upon by the Commonwealth concerning forfeiture of property are not in contest, and the concept is clearly recognised: see for example Customs and Excise Commissioners v. Air Canada [1991] 2 QB 446. In that decision the Court upheld the validity of a forfeiture of an aircraft which was involved in the carriage of cannabis resin, even though the owners of the aircraft were unaware of that fact. Whilst the law providing for forfeiture may appear harsh, that is the necessary consequence of its operation regarding property rights. In the present circumstances forfeiture occurred when the vessel was used or involved in a ' contravention of this Act '. Such contravention occurred by the bringing in or coming into Australia of one or more persons who were or became unlawful non-citizens, contrary to s 42 of the Migration Act . The text of s 261A of the Migration Act is unambiguous. In these circumstances the authorities relied upon by the applicant have no scope for application.

Case1000,Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215,"applicant relies upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Dimella Constructions Pty. Ltd v Stocker and Stocker (1976) 14 SASR 215 in which the Court at 221-222 considered the meaning of the word 'contravention'. Additionally, the applicant submits that the principle of interpretation that Parliament is not taken to deprive persons of property rights without expressing its intention in unmistakable and unambiguous terms applies: see Coco v R (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437-438. The applicant relies upon the decision of Dimella Constructions , in which the Court was asked whether s 21(5) of the Builder's Licensing Act 1967 (SA) would apply to a builder even if a charge under ss 21(2) or (11) could be defended by the common law defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Section 21(5) stated that: Where a person has carried out or undertaken, or submitted a bid or tender, to carry out any building work in contravention of this section, he shall not be entitled to claim, or recover in any court, the amount of any fee or charge for any building work... Section 21(2) imposed a penalty on a person who held himself or herself out as having a building licence without having a licence and s 21(11) imposed a penalty for constructing a building for a fee without a licence. The conduct of the charged party satisfied the descriptions of such offences, but the Court found that he was adequately protected by the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact because he believed himself to be licensed. Bray CJ (with other judges agreeing) found at page 221 that: I think a man does not transgress a law if he is legally innocent of breaking it and entitled to acquittal if charged with a breach of it, nor, in such circumstances, does he go counter to it or come into conflict with it. At 222, Bray CJ concluded: If it is a characteristic of any contravention that it could result in a penalty after conviction for a punishable offence, then e converso when there can be no penalty, because there can be no convention because there is no punishable offence, there is no contravention. The meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK). In view of the applicant's further submissions, the decision in Dimella Constructions and the preceding discussion, the Court finds itself unable to ignore the judicial findings which have had the result that all those charged with offences under the Migration Act have been acquitted. Contravention may not always equate to a criminal offence. However, due to the structure of the Criminal Code it must follow that a failure to find criminal responsibility must also lead to finding that a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Migration Act creating offences does not exist. The defence upon which the acquittals or discontinuances of the charges against the applicant and others was based, namely sudden or extraordinary emergency as provided by s 10.3 of the Criminal Code , applies equally to any offence with which the applicant or any other person on board the ship could be charged. As has been stated, the relevant question is whether the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that a contravention of the Migration Act has occurred. The Court can no longer be so satisfied that contraventions have occurred in respect of any offences under the Migration Act .

Case1005,NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161,"was submitted by the applicant that by virtue of Australia being a signatory to the Refugee Convention and following from the judgment of Kirby J in NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161 at [89] , the Court ought to read s 261A in a way which conforms with Australia's international obligations and should not be read to punish refugees. There are two primary problems with this submission. As the Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ found (at [15]) in NAGV , ...the Convention is an example of a treaty which qualifies what under classical international law theory was the freedom of States in the treatment of their nationals; but the Convention does not have the effect of conferring upon the refugees to which it applies international legal personality with capacity to act outside municipal legal systems. [footnotes omitted] Crucially, their Honours said at [17], ...Gibbs CJ and Brennan J in Mayer and Stephen J in Simsek v Macphee pointed out that the determination of the status of refugee is a function left by the Convention to the competent authorities of the Contracting States which may select such procedures as they see fit for that purpose. [footnotes omitted] It follows that the legal concept of 'refugee' is a status which is not conferred upon a person merely by the existence of circumstances sufficient to support such a claim. This status must positively be found, and it must be found according to the standards set by the particular state, in this case, Australia. Such concept is consistent with international law only having effect within Australia by virtue of its positive adoption into municipal law. Accordingly, the passengers on the ship were not refugees until such time as they were granted that status from the Australian authorities pursuant to s 36 of the Migration Act (dealing with protection visas), and that was not until well after the facts giving rise to the contravention had occurred. At their time of entry into Australia (and thus the time when the forfeiture occurred) the ship's passengers were no more than unlawful non-citizens by force of s 14 of the Migration Act . Therefore it could not be said that forfeiture of the ship would punish the applicant as a refugee, because at the relevant time he was not a refugee, and nor was anyone else on the ship. After the fact events such as the granting of refugee status cannot affect the validity of the forfeiture. Secondly, the passage relied upon by the applicants at [89] of NAGV states, ' where the words of a statute are susceptible to an interpretation that is consistent with international law, that construction should prevail over one that is not .' The key word is ' susceptible '. Section 36 is clearly intended to operate subsequently to s 261A because s 261A will occur automatically the moment a vessel enters Australia. There is nothing in s 261A that suggests that it should be limited in its operation by s 36 of the Migration Act so that it has no application to people to whom s 36 applies. Whether s 36 applies to an unlawful non-citizen may not be known until years after a vessel's entry in Australia, and s 261A is phrased as to operate instantaneously. Reading s 261A in the way the applicant submits completely ignores the wording of the section. It must therefore be concluded that it is not a provision which can be said to be ' susceptible ' in the manner discussed by Kirby J.

Such section provides for the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of boats, traps and other things used in offences against various provisions of that Act. His Honour said at [79]: It was contended for the applicants that before s 106A could operate to effect forfeiture of a boat or its equipment or catch it was necessary that there be a conviction for one or more of the offences upon which such forfeiture was said to arise. As a matter of construction this proposition cannot be sustained. Where there has been a conviction for an offence forfeiture can be ordered by the convicting court under s 106. Section 106A does not require any judicial determination to give effect to the forfeiture for which it provides albeit a judicial determination may be made if the occurrence of the forfeiture is contested in later proceedings. In such proceedings a civil court may make a finding whether the boat has been used in one of the specified offences. Absent the institution of such proceedings within 30 days of a notice of seizure under s 106C the asserted forfeiture will be put beyond question by operation of s 106E. That process requires no conviction to have been recorded. I reject the contention that s 106A depends for its application upon a conviction for one or more of the offences mentioned in it.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.034,0.065,0.901,-0.8035,0.21875

Angel ACJ expressly refused to follow one aspect of Rutu in R v Ampi Hungan [2000] NTSC 84 , however, that aspect of Rutu is irrelevant for current purposes. His Honour's finding in relation to s 42 is unambiguous and the Court respectfully follows the finding of Angel J. As has been stated, s 261A does not require a section of the Migration Act creating an offence to have been contravened for forfeiture to occur. All that it requires is that the Migration Act be contravened in such a way as to satisfy s 261A(1)(a). Travelling to Australia without a visa is a contravention of s 42 of the Migration Act , and such act in the circumstances constituted a convention sufficient to satisfy s 261A(1)(a).

The ship was validly forfeited. No question of payment of compensation arises where the forfeiture results from the incidental exercise of power under the Migration Act since s 51(xxxi) ' applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms ': see Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited and Another v The Commonwealth of Australia and Another [1997] HCA 38 ; (1997) 190 CLR 513 per Gummow J at 595; see authorities referred to in Tran No. 1 at [51]-[53]; see also Mutual Pools &amp; Staff Pty.

Case1017,Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237,"word 'contravention' may mean a breach of the law, but 'contravention' ' does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence unless the Act or law otherwise makes it so ': see Re Venice Nominees Pty Ltd (Receiver and Manager appointed) (In liquidation) (1992) 108 FLR 237 at 242 referred to in Tran No. 1 at [28]. Conduct may be proscribed by Parliament, and the finding that such conduct has occurred may lead to the conclusion that a contravention of the law has occurred without an offence having been committed. However, facts may exist to satisfy a court that conduct constitutes not only a contravention, but simultaneously an offence. The text of the relevant statute must be considered in order to decide whether contravention means merely a breach of its provisions or commission of an offence. The applicant invites the Court to find that because the word 'offences' is used in the heading of s 261A, the conclusion must be reached that the word 'contravention' used in s 261A should be limited only to a contravention of those sections of the Migration Act which create offences. Pursuant to s 15AB(1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act extrinsic material can be considered as an aid to interpretation where the text of the provision itself is ' ambiguous or obscure '. By s 13(3) the heading to a section does not form part of the statute. However, by s 15AB(2)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act the headings to sections comprise extrinsic material. Therefore, the pivotal consideration is whether the text of s 261A is ambiguous or obscure, so as to enable the Court to refer to the heading of s 261A when interpreting that section.

Case1018,Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265,"this conclusion, the Migration Act has nevertheless been contravened by the applicant because of a breach of s 42 of the Migration Act , as was found in Tran No. 1 at [48]. In Rutu and Another v Dalla Costa (1997) 139 FLR 265 Angel J said at 270: They intended to so enter without a visa. Thus they intended to enter in contravention of the Migration Act , not in the sense of being in breach of an express provision to do so I note s 42 relates to travelling to Australia without a visa rather than entering Australia without a visa but in the sense of disregarding the visa requirements of the Act.

Case1019,Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1,"considerations apply to the heading of Division 13A of Part 2 of the Migration Act which also contains the word 'offences.' Pursuant to s 13(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act a heading of a Division is part of the Act. In Silk Bros. Proprietary Limited v State Electricity Commission of Victoria [1943] HCA 2 ; (1943) 67 CLR 1 , Latham CJ said at 16: The headings in a statute...can be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of a provision where that provision is ambiguous, and may sometimes be of service in determining the scope of a provision... ""But where the enacting words are clear and unambiguous, the title, or headings, must give way, and the full effect must be given to the enactment"" ( Bennett v. Minister for Public Works (N.S.W.) [1908] HCA 50 ; (1908) 7 C.L.R. 372 at 383). The Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the text of s 261A. The section speaks of the contravention of the Migration Act as a whole. Ambiguity might arise when that section is read with the heading to the Division, but as observed by Latham CJ, the headings may provide guidance only when the provision itself is ambiguous. Following from the finding that the provision is unambiguous the text of the heading must give way. It may be assumed that if Parliament had intended automatic forfeiture to occur only where 'offences' existed, it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have so provided, taking into consideration the choice of the word 'offences' in the heading of Division 13A of Part 2. It follows that the operation of the automatic forfeiture provision in s 261A of the Migration Act is not limited only to contraventions of the offence provisions of that Act nor is it dependent upon a conviction for an offence. The Court reiterates its finding at [31] of Tran No 1 . Has there been a contravention of the Migration Act ? As has been outlined in [18]-[20] of this judgment, ordinarily the Court cannot revisit a previous judgment that it has made. In Tran No. 1 at [31] the Court found that the Migration Act had been contravened by the applicant. However, a reading of that paragraph also records that the Court provided such answer within the context of a submission by the applicant that 'contravention' in s 261A should be made to be equated with 'offence' in order to enliven an automatic forfeiture. This Court, as stated at [33] of this judgment, finds that the word 'contravention' in s 261A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions, and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence. The applicant has made a different submission at the subsequent hearing. The applicant now submits that, as a consequence of the acquittals or discontinuance of actions against the applicant, Mr Lai and Mr Nguyen, the automatic forfeiture never took place because the facts giving rise to automatic forfeiture under s 261A , namely contravention of the Migration Act , were never present. Such a submission does not depend on contravention being equated to an offence, nor to conviction of an offence. As was stated at [30]-[31] of Tran No. 1 , following the decision of French J in Olbers , for the automatic forfeiture to arise the Court ' must be satisfied to a high degree of probability ' that contraventions of the Migration Act exist. In Tran No. 1 the Court stated that it was so satisfied but only in the narrow context of that which was submitted relating to the meaning of the word contravention. The new submissions justify the Court considering the new submissions separately to the decision already made even though a different interpretation of the same facts may result in a conclusion incompatible to the answers already given in Tran No. 1 .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.026,0.05,0.924,-0.9228,-0.20579999999999954

Case1022,Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290,"16 June 2008 the Court delivered its findings in respect of specific questions which were asked of it pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth): see Tran v The Commonwealth [2008] FCA 901 ; (2008) 103 ALD 290 (' Tran No. 1 '). Since the facts and legislation are set out in that decision, the present decision should be read in conjunction with Tran No. 1 . In Tran No. 1 the Court found that s 261A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act ') operated to effect an automatic forfeiture of the ship Hao Kiet BL91693TS ('the ship') on or about 1 July 2003 when the ship entered Australia carrying persons who held no valid Australian visas. To answer the specific questions the Court was provided with an agreed statement of facts. The determination of such questions did not finally resolve the rights of the parties since an automatic forfeiture brought about by s 261A of the Migration Act remains contestable: see Tran No. 1 at [45]. The continuation of the hearing in respect of which this judgment is now delivered provided the applicant with the opportunity to provide any evidence upon which he relied to dispute that forfeiture of the ship had occurred. In Tran No. 1 the Court referred to the automatic forfeiture as ' the purported forfeiture ' (at [49]), only as a means of indicating that in these proceedings the applicant could challenge the forfeiture under the mechanism explained in that decision, that is, through the condemnation process. On 9 September 2008 the applicant filed a Further Amended Application seeking a declaration that the ship is not forfeited, or, in the alternative, a declaration that any forfeiture ' including under s 261A of the Migration Act , is revoked ' and further declarations relating to the right of the applicant to possession of the ship. The Further Amended Application also seeks declarations relating to claims for damages arising from the alleged unauthorised destruction and/or loss of possession of the ship. A Further Amended Statement of Claim was also filed on 9 September 2008. The Further Amended Statement of Claim raised the following claim (at [4]): At all material times the Applicant was responding to a sudden and extraordinary emergency and believed that each of the Vietnamese citizens who so fled from Vietnam to Australia were entitled to receive protection from Australia by virtue of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugee ['the Refugee Convention ']. For these reasons the applicant submits that there is no relevant contravention of the Migration Act , and that in the absence thereof there has been no forfeiture and accordingly the Court should not confirm the automatic forfeiture. The applicant invites the Court to revisit its findings in Tran No. 1 in light of its further submissions. The applicant claims that there has been a trespass to his property or intentional or negligent interference with his property and that just terms are payable under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) in respect of the loss of the ship. The claim for damages is itemised in the amount of $307,274.85.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.048,0.056,0.897,-0.6792,0.6337999999999999

Case1025,Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645,"Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vict.) [1987] HCA 26 ; (1987) 162 CLR 645 Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ discussed the origins of the modern law of self defence. They observed that such defence arose out of a context in which two kinds of defence to homicide, a defence of 'justification' and one of 'excuse', were available. The consequences of each defence were distinct, as their Honours considered at 657-658: Justifiable homicide carried with it commendation rather than blame and accordingly entitled the accused to total acquittal, entailing no forfeiture and requiring no pardon... Excusable homicide, on the other hand, was not entirely without blame and merely excused rather than acquitted, requiring, at first, a pardon and involving, for a somewhat longer period, forfeiture. Such distinctions no longer exist, but this context led their honours to find (at 658) that self defence, ' as we now know it, was essentially exculpatory in origin '. The difference between the defences considered above demonstrates that, at the common law at least, one might be said to a have contravened the law even if a defence to a charge were available. There can be no doubt that the Criminal Code was intended to provide a principled and logical analytical regime for Commonwealth criminal law and thus substantially remove inconsistencies found in the common law. For example, the defence of necessity at common law did not apply to murder: see R v Dudley and Stephens (1884) 14 QBD 273. However, the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency is not so limited in the Criminal Code and it applies to all Commonwealth offences. The Criminal Code codified a basis for criminal responsibility distinct from that at common law as discussed in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440 ; (2005) 65 NSWLR 75. Spigelman CJ said of the structure of the Criminal Code (at [28]): Criminal responsibility under the Code arises from the combined effect of the presence of the elements in Pt 2.2 [General Principles of Criminal Responsibility] and the absence or failure of the elements in Pt 2.3 [Circumstances in which there is no Criminal Responsibility]. This structure differs from the position at common law in which it is appropriate to treat certain matters as ""defences"", for example, self defence is ""exculpatory"". ( Zecevic (at 658-659)). [Emphasis added] In an article published in Judicial Review entitled ' The Commonwealth Criminal Code : An Introduction to the General Principle s' the author Ian Leader-Elliot wrote:- Proof of the necessary physical and fault elements does not, of itself, establish guilt.

Chapter 2 [of the Criminal Code ] adopts a binary structure in which ""responsibility"" is a compound resulting from proof of all elements of the offence, combined with disproof or failure of all defences that are open on the evidence... There are, it should be said, significant departures from the common law in the articulation of a number of offences. [(2002) 5 Judicial Review 4 at 301] On such analysis, if the requirements of s 10.3 are satisfied it must follow that there can be no criminal responsibility and therefore no offence.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.108,0.151,0.741,-0.992,-0.4289999999999998

The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which is the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.' By using the phrase 'prima facie case', their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial."" 10 Whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction requires the exercise of a discretion informed by the application of these principles to the circumstances of the case as revealed by the material before the court at the time of the application. 11 The Applicants' claim for infringement of copyright is not, in my opinion, a strong one on present materials.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.115,0.082,0.803,0.9323,6.23005

An inspection of these discloses title blocks in which Linmac's name and ownership is stated. There is though, no overt claim of confidentiality or even copyright on the face of the drawings. Neither is there evidence of any written confidentiality agreement ever used at any stage by an alleged owner of the drawings in dealings with third parties. 28 There is evidence of a practice adopted by Linmac of allowing third parties to have copies of such drawings of its plans as where necessary in order to effect repairs. At best, it might perhaps be inferred that, as a matter of business practice, it was mutually understood as between Linmac or its alleged successive assignees and third parties that the drawings contained at least some confidential information.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.115,0.025,0.859,0.9836,6.349600000000001

The Courts are therefore careful to ensure that the plaintiff gives full and proper particulars of all the confidential information upon which he intends to rely in the proceedings. If the plaintiff fails to do this the Court may infer that the purpose of the litigation is harassment rather than the protection of the plaintiff's rights and may strike out the action as an abuse of process."" . 31 The Respondents do not seek that the proceedings be struck out. That is not to say that the sentiments voiced in the passages just quoted are irrelevant. The First Respondent is certainly embarked upon a path that may see it come to be a competitor of the Applicants. It is a serious thing to allege that persons have breached a duty of confidence in respect of confidential information. There is force, in my opinion, in the Respondents' submission that there is no evidence that any of them have misused or are going to misuse any confidential information of the Applicants. It must be observed as well that similar difficulties to those which I have highlighted in relation to the breach of copyright claim attend the proof of the Applicants' ownership of the allegedly confidential information. Further, just what is said to constitute the information having the necessary quality of confidence is not identified with precision on the present state of the evidence. That in itself is telling as a person to whom injunctive relief is granted ought not be put in a position of doubt as to what is enjoined. 32 In short then it seems to me that, on the present state of the materials, the basis for there being a serious question to be tried is at least weak but better regarded as wanting.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.076,0.07,0.854,0.6486,5.264099999999999

Case1046,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608,"By order made herein dated 7 November 2007 I appointed Mr Colin Nicol as receiver to deal with certain funds which had been held in the names of the respondent, the Terra Nova Cache and the Principality of Camside. The circumstances in which the receiver came to be appointed are explained in my judgment in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. Mr Nicol entered on his task promptly. He has discovered various funds which are additional to those which are identified in Schedule A of the order made on 7 November 2007. He has also identified a large number of persons who claim to have made deposits in the Terra Nova Cache. He has sought the co-operation and assistance of the respondent in identifying depositors and the whereabouts of moneys contributed by them. He has received very little assistance from the respondent in response to these requests. 2 By an Amended Notice of Motion dated 4 February 2008 Mr Nicol seeks various orders to assist him in the performance of his duties. I heard argument on the Amended Notice of Motion on 6 February 2008. Following argument I indicated that I would make orders in the terms of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Motion and would publish reasons for doing so at a later date. I reserved judgment on whether orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Amended Notice of Motion should be made. What follows are my reasons for making orders 1 to 3 and my reasons, following further consideration, for determining that orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 5 and 6 (with some minor variations) should be made. 3 The first order sought by Mr Nicol is the addition of a number of funds to those identified in Schedule A of the order which I made on 7 November 2007. The evidence established, in each case, a reasonable basis for the conclusion that the source of the moneys in those funds was contributions made to the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside. Counsel for the respondent did not direct any specific argument to the question of whether order 1 should or should not be made. It is appropriate that the order should be made. 13 Counsel for the receiver argued that these orders should be made because the respondent had, during the period of the receivership, failed to respond to requests made by the receiver that he provide relevant documents to the receiver. In particular the receiver relied on the failure of the respondent to comply with paragraph five of the orders made on 7 November 2007 which required the respondent to provide to the receiver ""all bank statements, books of accounts, receipts, invoices, correspondence or other documents in his possession, custody, power or control relating to monies received from members of the public for deposit in the Terra Nova Cache."" The receiver's solicitor had written on numerous occasions to the respondent requesting that he comply with the Court's order. The respondent had not done so. He had, through his solicitors, made general claims that he could not be required to produce any documents because of the protection afforded him by the privilege against self incrimination. In one letter the respondent acknowledged that he had three documents (bank statements) which fell within the terms of the order. He also provided the receiver with a copy of documentary evidence tendered in the course of the trial of the principal proceeding in which the order appointing the receiver was made: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. The respondent has failed to advise the receiver whether there are additional documents, which although not in his possession, are within his power or control. 14 Counsel for the respondent opposed the making of the proposed orders. He made what he described as ""an in limine objection"" to the making of any order that would require the respondent to swear an affidavit of documents or discover any documents on the ground that to do so would infringe his right to protection against self incrimination. 15 In making the in limine objection counsel for the respondent relied on an affidavit, sworn by the respondent, in which he deposed that: ""3. It has been alleged that with respect to the Principality of Camside and Terra Nova Cache, I am in breach if the Banking Act , sections 7 and 66 , which are respectively an indictable offence and an offence. Such allegations have already been tried herein and found proven on a civil basis, and it has been maintained by APRA, a Commonwealth instrumentality, that the right to bring criminal charges against me with respect of the alleged breaches of the relevant sections remains extant. 4. The documents requested clearly relate to the alleged breaches of the Act and, accordingly, I object to producing the same pursuant to the right against self incrimination."" It is noted that the respondent makes an in limine objection to production. He does not identify the documents for which a privilege claim is made. He does not explain why their production would tend to incriminate him. Moreover he offers no reason why he should not be required to swear an affidavit of documents. 19 As already noted counsel for the respondent sought to argue that the circumstances which confronted the respondent in this case were such as to bring it within the exceptional category which Deane J referred to in Refrigerated Express.

He submitted that his client had been found, in Siminton (No 6) , to have contravened ss 7 and 66 of the Banking Act . These findings had been made on the civil standard. His client apprehended that he might, at some time in the future, be charged with having committed criminal offences by contravening those provisions.

Case1047,Refrigerated Express Lines (A/sia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204,"Counsel acknowledged that the circumstances in which an in limine objection to making an affidavit of documents, in a case such as the present, might be upheld are extremely rare. He contended that the circumstances of the present case brought it within the rare exception, the existence of which was recognised by Deane J in Refrigerated Express Lines (A/asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live Stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204. In Refrigerated Express Deane J held that, in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding in which the imposition of a pecuniary penalty was sought, a Court should not order a respondent to give discovery or produce documents for inspection. In other forms of proceeding his Honour recognised that the general rule was that a party ought not to be excused, in limine , from giving discovery on the ground that production might tend to expose him to a penalty. His Honour held that there might exist ""exceptional"" cases in which ""the only means of protecting the right against self incrimination ... [would be] to excuse a party in limine from discovery ..."" (at 211) (Emphasis added). His Honour said that such cases would be ""rare indeed."" He said (at 211) that: ""The cases where the making of an order for discovery or interrogatories will, in itself, involve exposing a party to self incrimination ... must, however, be rare indeed in view of the fact that the party will remain entitled to refuse to answer questions asked or produce documents discovered if the answers or production might tend to incriminate him or expose him to a penalty.""

Their Honours noted that: ""There [in Refrigerated Express] his Honour drew a distinction between discovery in a mere action for a penalty and discovery in an action which was not for a penalty the result of which might be used to establish a party's liability to a penalty in other proceedings (50). In the first situation, the court should, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, refuse to make any order for discovery, production of documents or the provision of information for the reason that an intended consequence of the discovery, production of documents or provision of information is the imposition of the penalty, this being the object of the action ... But in the second situation the order will be made and the party against whom the order is made may object to the production of particular documents or to the provision of particular information on the ground that it may tend to expose him to a penalty."" 17 In Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 Lindgren J reviewed a series of cases in which Deane J's decision in Refrigerated Express had been applied or followed.

Case1052,Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458,"preliminary attack was made on the use of the concept of point of origin or destination of a service as a reference point able to be used in the Notices. It was contended that the Notices (even if confined to outbound services) did not sufficiently describe a matter involving a contravention of the Act, particularly in failing to describe the market in Australia. I accept that just because services cover the movement of goods in or out of Australia, does not necessarily indicate that there is a relevant market located in Australia in respect of those services: see Auskay International Marketing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 at [19] and [21] per Tracey J. However, as I mention later, the Notices when properly construed adequately describe matters capable of involving a contravention of the Act and by reference to a market in Australia. I make one further observation as to the Notices. The identified matters concern the alleged contravention of s 45 of the Act and concentrate on the supply of the international air cargo services. However, as I have alluded to earlier, it is important to observe that the description of the matters in the Notices concern price fixing as defined by s 45A of the Act, and it is upon that provision attention should be focussed in interpreting the Notices. Justice Tracey in Auskay FCA 1458 did observe that '[b]uyers and sellers of goods and services must negotiate and enter transactions in an area in which suppliers are engaged in close competition with each other' and '[t]hat area must be located within Australia' (at [19]). However, his Honour also referred to the importance of the place where the relevant competition takes place, and where parties compete to obtain contracts (at [21]). I do not read his Honour's comments (made in the context of a pleading dispute) as dictating that in determinating the geographic location of the market one is confined by the location of the making of the contract for the subject services. Once it is accepted that the place of contracting is not determinative, then in view of the above reasoning, it cannot be concluded that the particular conduct complained of is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. We are not then dealing with a market that is wholly outside Australia, but rather, with a possible contravention s 45 of the Act in relation to inbound and outbound services in a market in Australia. Therefore, upon construing the Notices in the manner indicated, I do not regard them as invalid on the ground that the matters the subject of them extend beyond conduct that is capable of constituting a contravention of the Act.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.062,0.023,0.914,0.885,6.0555
Case1053,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976,"notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): Although the notion of a ""market in Australia"" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a ""market in Australia"" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. Justice Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).",Criminal Case,Rape,0.065,0.035,0.9,0.8442,5.9247
Case1054,Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J). (g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468): It is for an applicant to make out its case of ""failure to take into account"", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.038,0.038,0.923,-0.7311,0.43815000000000026

In addition, sometimes it will also be necessary to have established the facts upon which legal issues can be resolved. In the Singapore Airlines proceeding, the parties filed a statement of agreed facts concerning the supply of international air cargo services, which included the following statements and facts: The following facts are agreed between the parties for the purpose of s 191 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Unless stated otherwise, the facts are applicable as at all relevant times, being the period 1 January 2000 to date. 1. Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) is incorporated in Singapore. SIA supplies international air transport services to passengers on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. The hub of SIA's international passenger services is in Singapore. Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA operated a Cargo Division which supplied air transport services for cargo on routes between many different countries, including on routes between Australia and other countries. Air freight is transported either in the 'bellyhold' or lower deck of passenger aircraft or in cargo 'freighters', i.e. planes dedicated to carrying cargo. Prior to 1 July 2001, SIA's Cargo Division supplied international air freight services using both passenger aircraft and cargo freighters. Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd (SIAC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIA. It is incorporated in Singapore. With effect on 1 July 2001, SIA transferred to SIAC the assets, liabilities, cargo-related contracts, operations and business activities of the Cargo Division of SIA. With effect on 3 July 2001, employees of the Cargo Division of SIA ceased to be employed by SIA and were transferred to SIAC. Since that time, only SIAC has supplied international air transport services for cargo within the Singapore Airlines group of companies. SIAC conducts business in 57 countries worldwide including Australia and SIA or SIAC operate aircraft in 38 countries. SIAC or its general sales agents operate out of 76 stations located at international airports to or from which SIAC will carry or arrange for the carriage of cargo. A list of those countries and stations is annexed and marked ""A"". Each station provides services in relation to the airport at which it is located. In Australia, SIAC currently operates stations at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth international airports. The stations that SIA previously operated at Cairns and at Darwin were closed in March 2001. To supply international air transport services for cargo, SIAC purchases from SIA all non-passenger baggage space in the bellyhold of SIA's passenger airplanes and also operates cargo freighters. The operating fleet of SIAC as at 31 March 2007 comprised 14 B747-400 cargo freighters. SIAC also purchases cargo space from other carriers, or carriage services by road transport operators. Typically SIAC will do this in order to deliver freight to airports which are not serviced by either SIA or SIAC aircraft or to allow stations to access available cargo space on SIA or SIAC aircraft which are operated from another station. Singapore is the main hub and freight distribution centre for SIAC. Charts depicting the routes flown by SIAC freighter aircraft and SIA passenger aircraft as at March 2007 are shown in the routing charts annexed and marked ""B"". SIAC can offer a freight service from any of its origin ports to Australia, routed through Singapore. The types of freight that are shipped from different countries and different cities can differ substantially. Carriers offer different types of air freight services from different locations in order to meet the requirements of the particular types of freight that are transported from those locations. For example, much of the freight shipped out of Melbourne is perishables such as meat, fruit and vegetables. This type of freight may need to be transported quickly and kept at special temperatures. ... (The annexures referred to above are not annexed to this judgment.) A substantial amount of additional evidence was adduced by the parties in both proceedings, and the ACCC cross-examined a number of witnesses called by Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Evidence received in each proceeding was to be treated as evidence in the other. Some objections were taken to certain evidence sought to be tendered by the parties, which in light of the approach I adopt, need not be ruled upon. No attack was made upon the credit of any witness, although the ACCC submitted that the evidence was far from conclusive and should not be relied upon as contended for by the applicants. Some of the evidence was of a confidential nature and appropriate orders were made under ss 17 and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In giving these reasons for judgment I have not found it necessary to refer to this evidence other than in a general way. The primary purpose of the evidence led was to provide the factual background concerning the markets in which international air cargo services are ordinarily supplied. Such evidence was said to support the argument that the Court could be satisfied that international air cargo services on routes into Australia, and between two points outside Australia, are not competitively provided in a market in Australia. Evidence was also led concerning what became known as the 'burden issue'. That evidence dealt with the steps required to be taken by Singapore Airlines and Emirates to comply with some of the notices. It also concerned the manner and extent to which Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the recipients, and what considerations he took into account in deciding to issue the Notices.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.061,0.017,0.922,0.9912,6.4252
Case1056,Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision.

(d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]).

Case1057,Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.042,0.045,0.913,-0.9029,-0.15715000000000012

Initially, it appeared that these proceedings were going to concern the extent to which the Act extended to extraterritorial conduct.

Case1060,Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J). (g) In Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 136 ALR 453 , Lindgren J said (at 468): It is for an applicant to make out its case of ""failure to take into account"", but the circumstances may be such that the applicant will be aided in this task by an absence of evidence from the decision-maker on a particular matter, such as an absence of evidence giving rise to an inference of a failure to make further inquiries when a genuine taking into account would have called for them. In any event, for the reasons I have already given, whilst the burden of some of the Notices, having regard to the original time limit, was objectively harsh and oppressive, the decision to issue such Notices was not so unreasonable (or illogical or irrational) that it could not have been made in the circumstances. Even if I looked to the question of 'proportionally', it seems to me that having regard to the very nature, breadth and extent of the investigation, the consequences of the burden were not such as to demonstrate unreasonableness so as to impugn the decision: see discussion in Bruce 45 NSWLR 163, at 184-5 per Spigelman CJ. I would reach this conclusion even on the basis of the evidence sought to be tendered by the applicants on the burden issue, although its relevance may be questionable&#8212;see above [13]. A final point was raised by the ACCC that if the applicants succeeded only in relation to their arguments on burden, I should not grant the relief sought as the initial time frame for the Notices in contention has been extended by a variation to the Notices. That such variations have occurred is not in contention. The only attack of the applicants is on the decision to issue the Notices and the Notices in their original form. No complaint is now made as to the extended time frame, there being no attack on the decisions varying the Notices.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.049,0.079,0.873,-0.9843,-0.41205000000000025

The only available evidence suggesting that Mr Samuel might have taken into account the effect of issuing the Notices on the applicants is derived from the Reason to Believe papers, and the objective matters available to Mr Samuel at the time of the issuing of the Notices, including the Notices themselves. Many identical s 155 notices were issued at the same time to many airlines. The Reason to Believe papers seemed to be prepared in standard form for each such notice. This also applied to the 'burden' of the Notices. No allowance seems to have been made for the different burden that may have been imposed on different airlines by reason of the fact that their operations differed in scale and geographic scope.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.016,0.081,0.903,-0.8934,-0.061900000000000066
Case1066,Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163,"is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ).

It is important to keep in mind that it is an investigative power which is under consideration in these proceedings. As stated by the Full Court in Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd [1980] FCA 94 ; 47 FLR 163 (at 174): The investigative power may properly be exercised by inquiring into the existence of facts which do not themselves constitute a contravention or deny the possibility of a contravention. The power may properly be exercised to ascertain facts which may merely indicate a further line of inquiry, or which may tend to prove circumstances from which an inference can be drawn as to the existence of other facts which have a more immediate and proximate relationship to the matter under investigation. The applicants are involved in international activities, and decisions and discussions concerning the matter under investigation may readily be accepted as having occurred overseas, as well as in Australia. The conduct of the applicants wherever occurring could be relevant to the investigation of the matter as defined in the Notices. It is not for this Court to confine or restrict the course of an investigation if the powers conferred by s 155 have not been exceeded. In relation to the interpretation of the Notices, the applicants allege that the definition of 'Fuel Surcharge' is wide and unclear. However, to the extent that the applicants have responded to the Notices, they appear to have had no difficulty at all in understanding the meaning of the term. It seems to me that the applicants should be, and in fact are, well versed in the concept of 'Fuel Surcharge'.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.04,0.025,0.935,0.1551,3.5278500000000004

Similarly, Mason J in Peko Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; 162 CLR 24 said (at 40): The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion, and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned: ( Wednesbury Corporation , at 228).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.034,0.034,0.932,-0.743,0.39950000000000063
Case1069,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"seems to me that the 'burden' sections of the Reason to Believe papers were pro-forma statements. This is not necessarily to be unexpected. The use of such standard paragraphs is not fatal in itself. However, if a verbal formula is used 'to cloak the decision with the appearance of conformity with the law', the use of that formula will not save the decision from invalidity: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 266 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The 'burden' sections of the Rason to Believe papers in dealing with the time for compliance specifically refer to the magnitude of the burden imposed and to the time in which the recipient could provide the information and documents. Consideration was then given to the burden generally and, specifically, to the time in which a recipient would need to make the necessary searches and enquiries, collate the material necessary and obtain legal advice. Significantly, Mr Samuel was reminded that he needed to consider the magnitude of the burden. This indicates that the Reason to Believe papers did not contain the only information relied upon by Mr Samuel, although they contained recommendations. I am not satisfied that the requirement to comply within a certain limited time was imposed without regard to the ultimate burden which it would impose on the recipient, even on the facts as I have found as to the burden objectively imposed.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.024,0.123,0.853,-0.9713,-0.3005499999999999

There is a plethora of case law regarding the meaning of that term, but the High Court has warned that attempts to define 'market' too precisely are dangerous. In NT Power Generation Pty Ltd v Power and Water Authority (2004) 219 CLR 90 , the High Court advocated a broader approach, stating (at 117): The Act is seeking to advance the broad goal of promoting competition. Certain provisions of the Act, particularly in Pt IV, necessarily turn to a significant degree on expressions which are not precise or formally exact. One example is ""market"": there can be overlapping markets with blurred limits and disagreements between bona fide and reasonable experts about their definition, as in this case. Other examples are ""substantial"", ""competition"", ""arrangement"", ""understanding"", ""purpose"" and ""reason"" (which need only be a ""substantial"" purpose or reason: s 4F).

The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.077,0.072,0.851,-0.2732,2.0387999999999997
Case1072,Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 If the Notices were properly framed and only referred to services in relation to outbound routes, then on the applicants' case, the fact that there may be acquirers of those services outside Australia would not affect the validity of the Notices on this primary ground of attack. It would be accepted there is a market in Australia. No suggestion would be made that the Notices are enquiring into a matter not the subject of the Notice in reliance of the principles outlined in Bannerman [1984] FCA 156 ; 2 FCR 581 , Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 and Melbourne Steamship Co Ltd [1912] HCA 69 ; 15 CLR 333. It then remains to address the application of the principles enunciated in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 . Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ there observed (at 377-8): There remains to be considered the availability to the appellants of the grounds upon which they object to a particular requirement to produce documents, namely, that it is harsh, oppressive and unreasonable. The mere fact that compliance with a requirement to furnish information or to produce documents would be burdensome will not invalidate that requirement in a s.155 notice (see Melbourne Home of Ford v Trade Practices Commission (No. 3) ; Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman ). Nor will objective harshness, unreasonableness or oppressiveness of a requirement in such a notice constitute an independent ground of invalidity. If invalidity by reference to these qualities is to be established, it must be by reference to the implied general limitation upon the power conferred by s 155(1) of the Act to which reference has already been made, namely, that it is a condition of a valid exercise of the power that it be used in good faith for the purpose for which it was conferred and with regard to the effect that the exercise of the power will have upon those affected thereby. It is only if the harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness of a requirement in a s 155 notice is, in all the circumstances, such as to warrant the conclusion that the requirement could not have been imposed in good faith or could only have been imposed to achieve a collateral purpose or without regard to the burden which it would impose upon the recipient, that harshness, oppressiveness or unreasonableness will result in invalidity. (Emphasis added, citations omitted.) I have already concluded that Mr Samuel had regard to the burden imposed on the applicants. It now remains to consider the question of good faith, and a possible separate issue of unreasonableness. To a certain extent, the issues of failing to take into account the burden, good faith and unreasonableness overlap. Obviously, a requirement may be harsh, unreasonable and oppressive, and still not result in invalidity. As observed by Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 65 ; (1982) 152 CLR 460 , '[t]he power [under s 155] is a drastic power and is capable of abuse and must be exercised with care' (at 468). The time for compliance has statutory significance. The recipient is obliged to furnish the information sought within the time specified in the notice, and must produce the documents sought in accordance with the notice: subs 155(1). It is an offence to fail to comply: subs 155(5) and (6A). These are matters that needed to be considered by Mr Samuel, as they undoubtedly were, as part of the statutory context of issuing the Notices and as part of the consequences of non-compliance. Once one reaches the conclusion that the decision to issue the Notices was exercised with care, took into account the relevant considerations, and was not to be impugned on the basis of the principles in Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368 , then the reference to the statutory significance of compliance takes the argument no further. I now turn to the separate ground relied upon of unreasonableness. It may be that the concept of unreasonableness is caught within the principles of Pyneboard [1983] HCA 9 ; 57 FLR 368. Nevertheless, I do not consider that approaching the matter on the basis of unreasonableness, even if a separate ground to consider apart from the approach taken in Pyneboard , further advances the arguments of the applicants in support of their applications.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.06,0.065,0.875,-0.9626,-0.3641000000000001
Case1073,Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177,"addition Dawson J observed in Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 (at 198-99): Lying behind both of those questions is the concept of the market, a concept which is sometimes dealt with in a more complex manner than is necessary. A market is an area in which the exchange of goods or services between buyer and seller is negotiated. It is sometimes referred to as the sphere within which price is determined and that serves to focus attention upon the way in which the market facilitates exchange by employing price as the mechanism to reconcile competing demands for resources: see Stigler and Sherwin, ""The Extent of the Market"", (1985) 28 Journal of Law and Economics vol 28 (1985) 555 at p. 555. In setting the limits of a market the emphasis has historically been placed upon what is referred to as the ""demand side"", but more recently the ""supply side"" has also come to be regarded as significant. The basic test involves the ascertainment of the cross-elasticities of both supply and demand, that is to say, the extent to which the supply of or demand for a product responds to a change in the price of another product. Cross-elasticities of supply and demand reveal the degree to which one product may be substituted for another, an important consideration in any definition of a market. This is reflected in s 4E of the Trade Practices Act which provides: ""For the purposes of this Act, 'market' means a market in Australia and, when used in relation to any goods or services, includes a market for those goods or services and other goods or services that are substitutable for, or otherwise competitive with , the first-mentioned goods or services"" (My emphasis.) Important as they are, elasticities and the notion of substitution provide no complete solution to the definition of a market. A question of degree is involved &#8212; at what point do different goods become closely enough linked in supply or demand to be included in the one market &#8212; which precludes any dogmatic answer.

As Gleeson CJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [5] : ... to describe reasoning as illogical, or unreasonable, or irrational, may merely be an emphatic way of expressing disagreement with it.

Case1075,Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314,"my view, the Court does have a discretion to refuse relief in such circumstances, even to the extent the application is brought under s 163A of the Act: see, eg, Re Tooth &amp; Co Ltd [1978] FCA 9 ; (1978) 31 FLR 314. As I have said, time for compliance has been extended. This time frame is not in dispute. Documents have been delivered by the applicants to the ACCC by reason of some or all of the Notices. The applicants did not challenge the decision to issue the Notices or the Notices before supplying those documents. Some delay occurred before the applicants brought their applications in this Court. There is no suggestion that any prosecution is intended based upon the Notices and the original time frame for compliance. These would all be reasons for refusing as a matter of discretion the substantive relief sought by the applicants. In view of the above reasons, the applications should be dismissed. I will make orders to facilitate the parties reaching an agreement as to costs. In the event that no agreement is reached, then orders will be made as to the exchange of submissions on the issue of costs.

Case1076,Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608,"notion of a 'market in Australia' was recently referred to by Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Limited [2008] FCA 1976 , where his Honour stated (at [33]-[34]): Although the notion of a ""market in Australia"" in s 4E has been referred to in two cases ( Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd [2002] FCA 1608 at [21] per Hill J and Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) ATPR 42-256 at [19] per Tracey J), the concept has not been the subject of extensive judicial consideration. In Riverstone , Hill J rejected the proposition that in order to be a ""market in Australia"" a market must be wholly within Australia. His Honour said (at [21]) that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products. As the Commission points out, a contrary view would considerably reduce the efficacy and utility of the competition law provisions of the Act, especially in the modern telecommunications era. In my opinion, Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1608 was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products (or services). However, I do not take the reference by Hill J to a global market which includes Australia as arguably a market in Australia 'if sales are made [in Australia]' ([2002] FCA 1608 at [22] ) as making it a requirement that the contract under which services are supplied in Australia must be entered into in Australia or that the transactions themselves must be entered into in Australia. In my view, Hill J was simply proffering an example of how one might identify the possible location of competition, and was not providing a definitive statement that buyers and sellers of services must enter into transactions in Australia.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.021,0.026,0.953,0.0772,3.2752
Case1077,Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53,"Lindgren went on to conclude that the definition of ""market in Australia"" in s 4E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. As other aspects of the decision in Qantas [2008] FCA 1976 proceeded upon agreed facts, however, that case provides little assistance in determining the other issues raised before me which involved 'a concrete dispute reached after contest in argument': see Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at [62] (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ).",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.085,0.051,0.865,0.3612,4.2332
Case1078,S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357,"the outset I indicate that 'as a matter of logic and without the necessity to have all of the facts' it may be concluded in any given case that particular conduct is not capable of constituting a contravention of the Act: see S A Brewing Holdings Ltd v Baxt (1989) 23 FCR 357 at 377 per Wilcox J. Evidence may be admitted to show conclusively that, even without all of the facts, the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice would not be capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. However, evidence could not be led to show that there is in fact no contravention, assuming the particular conduct as described in a s 155 notice was capable of constituting a contravention of the Act. It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ). The applicants' evidence does not eliminate (as it must) any reasonable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the contention that the market is wholly outside Australia even if one focuses on the inbound services in isolation: see S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 370 and Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 at [9] and [52].

Case1080,Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170,"is also now an extensive body of judicial consideration on the scope and requirements of s 155 notices, but it is convenient to refer to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 267 ; (2004) 140 FCR 170. In that case Sackville and Emmett JJ set out the process for construing notices against the s 155 requirements, and stated (at 182-83): The authorities have established a number of propositions concerning the interpretation of s 155(1) of the TP Act. They include the following: (i) In a context where refusal or failure to comply with a s 155 notice is punishable by imprisonment or fine, the notice must: (a) convey with reasonable clarity to the recipient the information that must be furnished; and (b) disclose that the ACCC is entitled to require the recipient to furnish the specified information: Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 374, per curiam. (ii) The second of these requirements will not be satisfied unless it appears from the notice that the information sought is information ""relating"" to one or more ""matters"" of a kind described in s 155(1): Pyneboard v TPC at 375 ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369-70 ; Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 at 584, per Bowen CJ and Neaves J. However, the question whether a notice discloses the necessary ""relatedness"" is not to be approached in an ""over-technical or hypercritical way"": Pyneboard v TPC at 376. Moreover, the ""relatedness"" is to a proper inquiry into the suspected offences: Panelboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] FCA 98 ; (1981) 59 FLR 395 at 407, per Fox J. (iii) Section 155(1) does not require the Chairperson of the ACCC to have ""reason to believe"" that a specified matter constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. The Chairperson must, however, have reason to believe that the relevant person is capable of furnishing information relating to the matter specified in the notice: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179, per Brennan J (with whom Bowen CJ agreed); TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Fels [1992] HCA 55 ; [1992] ATPR 40 ,595 (41-190) at 40,598-40,599, per Gummow J. It follows that the Chairperson or other officer must believe that the person to whom the notice is directed is capable of furnishing information relating to the facts known or suspected: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. In addition, there must be facts in existence which are sufficient to induce that belief in a reasonable person: George v Rockett at 112. (iv) The word ""matter"" in s 155(1) is to be construed in its ordinary sense of an affair or thing: Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1979] FCA 15 ; (1979) 36 FLR 450 at 474, per Franki and Northrop JJ; SA Brewing v Baxt at 369. It refers to a body of facts which constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the TP Act. Whether or not the relevant body of facts constitutes a contravention is a matter of law and does not turn on the perception or knowledge of the ACCC or its officers: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (v) When s 155(1) speaks of a matter which may constitute a contravention, it refers to a body of facts not fully known and which may, when fully known, reveal themselves as constituting a contravention: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. The words ""may constitute"" enable a court to judge from the material in the notice whether, if other facts which may or may not have occurred come to light, the whole body of facts would constitute a contravention: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether a contravention has occurred; but equally it will not ""idly speculate"" or ""draw on improbable circumstances"" to uphold a notice: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. An alternative formulation is that the Court can take account of facts which may ""reasonably be suspected"" to have occurred: WA Pines v Bannerman at 179. (vi) Where the matter referred to in the notice, after allowing for undiscovered facts, is incapable of amounting to a contravention, the issue of the notice is not a valid exercise of the power conferred by s 155(1): SA Brewing v Baxt at 371-72. (vii) In view of the principle that a court should not adopt an ""over-technical or hypercritical approach"" to the construction of a notice, there is no requirement that the notice ""plead"" all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention of the TP Act: SA Brewing v Baxt at 370. (viii) Information which tends to negative a suspected contravention or liability to conviction or which tends to exculpate a person suspected to be a party to a contravention, is within the ambit of s 155(1). It follows that an inquiry under s 155 may relate to a defence or possible defence available to the suspected person: WA Pines v Bannerman at 180. This conclusion derives from the principles referred to in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , and accords with the reasoning of Bowen CJ and Neaves J (at 586-87) and Davies J (at 590-91) in Bannerman v Mildura Fruit Juices Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 156 ; (1984) 2 FCR 581 , the views expressed by the Full Court (Northrop, Deane and Fisher JJ) in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1982) 57 FLR 368 at 373-74 The correct starting point is to determine whether the matters identified in the Notices are incapable, after allowing for undiscovered facts, of constituting a contravention of s 45 of the Act by reference to the deeming provision of s 45A. As noted by Sackville and Emmett JJ in Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 '[u]ltimately, the question is whether the matter identified in the Notices ""may constitute"" a contravention of the [Act]' (at 184). The substantial challenge to the decision to issue the Notices, and to the Notices themselves, seized upon this concept of 'matter'; specifically, Emirates argued that the Notices should be set aside because they: relate to, and purport to require [the applicants] to furnish information and produce documents relating to, matters that cannot constitute a contravention of s 45(2) of the [Act] . Those matters concern alleged agreements or understandings relating to the supply of air cargo services on routes into Australia and routes between two or more points outside Australia. Such services are not supplied in competition in a market in Australia. By virtue of s 45(3) and 4E of the [Act] , it is only services supplied in competition in a market in Australia that can possibly found a contravention of s 45(2). Singapore Airlines essentially made the same submission. It was accepted by Emirates and Singapore Airlines that the evidence adduced in these proceedings was not intended to, nor would it enable, the Court to conclude whether all international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or in many different markets and the boundaries of those markets. It was said by Emirates, at least, that: (a) the Notices allege an arrangement containing provisions that fix the price of international air cargo services supplied by the parties throughout the world; (b) regardless of whether a conclusion is ultimately reached that international air cargo services are supplied in a single global market or many different markets, the supply of those services outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia cannot occur in a market in Australia within the meaning of the Act; (c) in so far as the alleged arrangement contained a provision fixing the price of international air cargo services supplied outside Australia to acquirers outside Australia, it does not satisfy the elements of s 45A; and (d) the conclusion in para (c) holds regardless of whether the parties to the arrangement also supply international air cargo services of the same kind in Australia to acquirers in Australia. It is important to recall that the Notices should not be read in an overly-technical way: they are to be 'reasonably, not preciously, construed': see Melbourne Home of Ford Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (No 3) [1980] FCA 94 ; (1980) 47 FLR 163 at 175-76 (per Brennan, Keely and Fisher JJ), and S A Brewing 23 FCR 357 at 369 (per Fisher and French JJ). In addition, regard may be had to the identity of, and the knowledge available to, the recipient of the notice: see Seven Network [2004] FCAFC 267 ; 140 FCR 170 , 189 at [75] (per Sackville and Emmett JJ).

It involves fact finding together with evaluative and purposive selection. In any given application it describes a range of economic activities defined by reference to particular economic functions (eg manufacturing, wholesale or retail sales), the class or classes of products, be they goods or services, which are the subject of those activities and the geographic area within which those activities occur. In its statutory setting the market designation imposes, on the activities which it encompasses, limits set by the law for the protection of competition. It involves a choice of the relevant range of activity by reference to economic and commercial realities and the policy of the statute.

Case1083,Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323,"principles relevant to this aspect of the proceedings can be simply stated: (a) The failure of a decision-maker to take into account a relevant consideration in the making of an administrative decision is an abuse of discretion entitling a party with sufficient standing to seek judicial review of the decision. (b) This ground of review can only be made out if the decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration that they are bound to take into account in making the decision. (c) The factors a decision-maker is bound to take into account in making a decision are determined by construction of the statute conferring the power. Where the matters to be taken into account are not expressly stated in the statute, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 per Mason J. (d) A decision-maker may not have had proper regard to a relevant consideration if they merely make a formalistic reference to the consideration: see Azriel v NSW Land &amp; Housing Corporation [2006] NSWCA 372 at [49] per Basten JA (with whom Santow and Ipp JJA agreed at [1] and [3]). (e) A decision-maker is required to give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to a relevant consideration: see Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Australian Securities Commission (1996) 136 ALR 453 at 468 (per Lindgren J); Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 185-6 per Spigelman CJ and the authorities cited therein. (f) The mere failure to refer expressly to a matter will not necessarily give rise to the inference that it was not taken into account: see Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 19 FCR 127 at 132 (per Burchett J). However, it is open to the Court to infer that a matter was not taken into account where no reference is made to it: see, eg, Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 349 (per Deane J).

Within the bounds of a market there is substitution substitution between one product and another, and between one source of supply and another, in response to changing prices. So a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive"". It is significant to note that consideration must be given to both actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers in identifying the 'field of rivalry' between competitors.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.046,0.0,0.954,0.765,5.631500000000001

Case1087,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1,"mere lack of resources does not of itself give rise to the kind of lack of state protection that is necessary to establish a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. As McHugh J observed in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 at [33] : ' [t] he inability of Australian governments to eliminate [death or serious injury from motor car accidents] does not determine whether the fear [of death or serious injury from a motor accident] is well-founded.' The second ground of appeal concerns whether or not any part of the Tribunal's reasons were based upon information that should have been disclosed to the appellant pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Act. Leave is required for the appellant to raise this ground as it was not argued before the Federal Magistrate. It is submitted by the appellant that s 424A(1) of the Act applies in this case in two ways. First, there was a reference in the Tribunal's reasons to country information that had been before the Delegate. The country information included the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to a series of questions apparently asked by the Tribunal concerning the status of women trafficking in Mongolia ('the response'). The appellant accepts that if the response was information of a kind to which s 424A(3)(a) of the Act applied it did not need to be disclosed to the appellant. However, the appellant submits that because the response commenced with the words ' SEVERAL FEMALE APPLICANTS CLAIM TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PROTESTING AGAINST WOMEN TRAFFICKING IN MONGOLIA ON BEHALF OF A LOCAL WOMENS SUPPORT GROUP ' (emphasis added), the information must be ' specifically about the applicant or another person ' and not ' just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member ' (s 434A(3)(a)). It is clear to me that when one looks at the response in its totality, the information relates only to a class of persons. All of the answers to the questions and the questions themselves relate to a class of persons, being victims of women trafficking or persons participating in protests against women trafficking, and not to any individual. Accordingly, even if that did form part of the information upon which the Tribunal relied, the Tribunal was not obliged to disclose the response to the appellant.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.031,0.101,0.868,-0.9787,-0.35545000000000027

Case1090,Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473,"In the appellant's submission, this approach demonstrated that the Tribunal was distracted from the question that is at the heart of any enquiry as to whether a person is a refugee, namely does the person have a well-founded fear of future persecution should that person be returned to their own country. This is the crucial issue and, as Gummow and Hayne JJ have noted, persecution in the past is neither necessary nor sufficient for an affirmative answer to that question. A person could have a well-founded fear of persecution even if there is no likelihood that those responsible for past persecution would be able to mete out similar treatment in the future or even if there had been no persecution in the past; Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [72] - [74] . 30 The Tribunal found that the appellant had a reputation as a troublemaker and that it was likely that this was at the root of his past treatment. That being so it was not sufficient to find that those responsible for that treatment would not seek him out in other parts of Egypt. It was necessary for the Tribunal to ask if the appellant is likely to continue with the conduct that marked him as a troublemaker in the past and, if so, whether that conduct would, in the future, evoke a similar response from others. The Tribunal is not entitled to base its prediction on an expectation that the appellant will modify his behaviour on his return to Egypt; Appellant S395/2002 at [40] per McHugh and Kirby JJ and at [80]-[82] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. 31 The appeal must be allowed with costs.

The phrase 'beneficial construction', as used in Wu Shan Liang has a specific meaning, and was certainly not intended to mean that any ambiguity in the Tribunal's reasons be resolved in the Tribunal's favour. Rather, the construction of the Tribunal's reasons should be beneficial in the sense that the Tribunal's reasons would not be over-zealously scrutinised, with an eye attuned to error. In this sense a 'beneficial' approach to the Tribunal's reasons does not require this Court to assume that a vital issue was addressed when there is no evidence of this and, indeed, the general thrust of the Tribunal's comments suggest that the issue was overlooked.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.129,0.037,0.833,0.93,6.16
Case1092,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's conclusion as to relocation was open to it, and that in reaching this conclusion the Tribunal correctly applied the test for relocation: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. 17 Before discussing the submissions made on appeal, I should mention one puzzling aspect of the Tribunal's reasons, namely the inconsistency between dates of various incidents described by the appellant. The Tribunal records that the appellant gave evidence that he was arrested twice in 2001 (in June and July) and that he left Egypt some four months after the second arrest, that is in late October 2001; however the material in the appeal book shows, and the Tribunal's opening paragraph records, that the appellant arrived in Australia on 25 October 2002 and that his application for a protection visa was lodged on 9 January 2003. There is no suggestion that the appellant came other than directly to Australia. Although the Tribunal mentioned that a psychologist who examined the appellant referred to the appellant's account as being one of detention and torture in 2002 the Tribunal did not dwell on this point and, as mentioned above, the Tribunal specifically stated that it was relying only on the account that the appellant gave at the hearing; see [5] above. 18 The appellant's primary submission in this Court is that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal misapplied the test for relocation, and in doing so made a jurisdictional error. I agree with this submission and, in general, with the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, Mr O'Donnell. 21 It must be emphasised here that it is the prospect of return to the applicant's own country not to a particular part or parts of that country that must be considered; Randhawa at 440. Provided that it is reasonably practicable for the person claiming refugee status to relocate with safety to another part of that country then it cannot be said that the person has a well-founded fear of persecution in that country. In such a case a finding that relocation meets these criteria will be a (or the) critical element in the determination of the application. Irrespective of the Tribunal's scepticism about aspects of the appellant's claims, is clear that the Tribunal's view as to the appellant's ability to relocate within Egypt with comparative ease was a critical element in its decision that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. 22 The Tribunal's consideration of the relocation issue logically raised three separate questions: (a) If the appellant relocated elsewhere in Egypt, would he face persecution from those who had targeted him previously? (b) Had the appellant's persistent campaigning against religious inequalities given him a national profile, such that others in Egypt would persecute him even if he relocated ? (c) If the appellant relocated elsewhere in Egypt, would he continue to engage in campaigns against religious inequality? If so, would this conduct lead others in Egypt (or even just in the area to which he relocated) to persecute him? 23 The Tribunal clearly addressed questions 1 and 2 above and answered them adversely to the appellant. Counsel for the Minister submitted that the third question was effectively answered by the Tribunal's statement: 'He did not suggest that he would attract new harassment by continuing to engage in the same kinds of activity as he had in the past.' 27 The Minister did not accept that the Tribunal had overlooked an essential issue and submitted that the scope of the Tribunal's obligation to consider future persecution of an applicant if relocated is determined by the appellant's claims and the material before the Tribunal. The Minister relied upon the judgment of Black CJ in Randhawa at 443: 'I agree that it would ordinarily be quite wrong for a decision-maker faced with a relocation possibility to take the general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere without giving the issue more specific attention, but the extent of the decision-maker's task will be largely determined by the case sought to be made out by an applicant .' (emphasis added) 28 In the Minister's submissions much was made of the fact that the relevant conduct of the appellant consisted of letter writing and the Tribunal could not be expected to investigate the possibility of the appellant facing persecution for his letter writing, which is not an activity that one would expect to provoke persecution. This is, with respect, a somewhat disingenuous submission. The appellant was not engaged in writing social letters; the Tribunal described him as embarking on 'a campaign of letter writing' which included letters of complaint to government departments. 29 Here, the questions of whether the appellant would continue his campaign of letter-writing in the future, and whether this conduct would lead to persecution elsewhere in Egypt, necessarily arose on the material before the Tribunal. It was the appellant's letter writing that the Tribunal accepted may have led to his unlawful detention by Giza police for three days. The Tribunal accepted that the appellant may have been beaten during this detention. It is no answer to say that letter writing per se is not an activity that tends to provoke violence the Tribunal had accepted that this was a possibility.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.046,0.074,0.881,-0.9774,-0.38990000000000036
Case1093,Federated Clerks Union of Australia v Victorian Employers Federation [1984] HCA 53 ; (1984) 154 CLR 472,"This interpretation takes too narrow a view of the meaning of the expression industrial conditions. There is nothing in the natural meaning of the expression which would prevent a requirement for union representation being described as an industrial condition. The statutory context suggests that such a requirement would fall within that description. The purpose of s 298K with s 298L(1)(l) is protective, that is to say, it is designed to prevent employees being prejudiced because they are dissatisfied with their working conditions where their union is taking steps to improve those conditions. Viewed this way the claim for union representation in the negotiation of a collective agreement falls within the statutory description. That view is supported by Webb v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1985) 10 IR 252 at 283 where Wilcox J said: ... [a] term such as ""industrial conditions"" should be construed liberally and so as to embrace arrangements for consultation between employer and employee in relation to matters arising out of that relationship and relevant to the working environment of employees, as such. His Honour based that approach on the judgments delivered in Federated Clerks Union of Australia v Victorian Employers Federation [1984] HCA 53 ; (1984) 154 CLR 472 , which held that the wider term ""industrial matters"" included a claim that a union be consulted in relation to technological changes.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.08,0.032,0.888,0.8153,5.80555
Case1094,Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 13 ALR 365,"Again it is convenient to approach this ground in a way most favourable to the respondent without determining whether the approach is correct in law. The respondent contended that s 298L(1)(l) required the conditions sought by the union and the conditions about which the applicant employees were dissatisfied to be the same: Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd (1976) 13 ALR 365 at 375. Further, the respondent submitted that this fact was a condition precedent to the application of s 298V and, hence, the onus lay on the applicants to demonstrate the coincidence of conditions. Whilst I doubt that the respondent is correct in this second submission concerning the construction of s 298V, nothing turns on resolution of the issue because, accepting for the purposes of argument the approach proposed by the respondent, the facts of the case do not support the conclusion contended for by it. 115 There was evidence that at all times Mr Whelan pursued the aim of having the respondent negotiate a collective agreement with the union. This is what he told the employees who attended the off site meetings in November and on 1 December 2005. Then, at the union meeting on 9 December 2005 he advocated a role for the union in negotiating an agreement with the respondent. That, he told the meeting, was the way to improve terms and conditions of employment. At the end of the meeting there was a vote in favour of the union negotiating a collective agreement with the respondent, and Mr Whelan initiated a bargaining period immediately following the vote. Mr Thornton acknowledged that Mr Whelan constantly tried to get the respondent to negotiate an agreement with the union. 116 There was evidence that the applicant employees also wanted the respondent to negotiate a collective agreement with the union in order to achieve an improvement in conditions of employment. Mr Kemmis and Mr Coon expressly stated their positions at the meeting on 9 December 2005. Mr Taylor described himself as one of the ""three amigos"" who, together with Mr Kemmis and Mr Coon, were agitating for the respondent to engage with the union to negotiate improved conditions. They were dissatisfied with the situation in which Mr Thornton refused to negotiate with the union.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.081,0.043,0.876,0.9472,6.277200000000001
Case1095,Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298,"On the contrary, the evidence which I accept is that Mr Sathaar, to whom Mr Coon answered, praised Mr Coon for his work on 9 December 2005. Mr Sathaar is still employed by the respondent and was available to give evidence. He was not called. Consequently, the Court is able more confidently to conclude that the evidence of Mr Sathaar would not have assisted the respondent on this question and to accept the evidence of Mr Coon that he was praised for his work on the day: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 ( Jones v Dunkel ) 47 Then, the evidence of the nature of the failings in Mr Coon's work was unsatisfactory and cast doubt on the accusation that Mr Coon had failed to fulfil his duties. There were a number of allegations made by Mr Thornton against Mr Coon which were so extravagant or so lacking in detail as to make them improbable. There were sufficient occasions of such evidence as to indicate that Mr Thornton's accusations against Mr Coon should not be relied upon. 48 For instance, in [6] of the respondent's contentions filed on 10 July 2007 prior to the hearing and authored by Mr Thornton prior to the respondent securing legal representation, it was said: The second applicant was placed on a dimensional checking role which he performed very poorly and resulted in the respondent shipping incorrect work and receiving rectification costs of approx $250,000. The respondent was served with a notice to produce which sought production of any documents relating to these costs. The respondent produced a credit note dated 30 June 2007, for $50,000 in favour of Monodelphous Pty Ltd. This represented the amount accepted by the respondent for rectification costs of the dispatch of steel on 9 December 2005. When this document was put to Mr Thornton in cross examination he said that he did not mean the contentions to say that Mr Coon was responsible for the whole $250,000 rectification costs. He said that the paragraph was just poorly worded and was prepared by him without assistance. Having regard to the centrality and seriousness of the allegations made, these explanations were, and came across in the witness box as, unconvincing. Further, the credit note came into existence well after the dismissal and could not have been the reason for it. Perhaps sensing these shortcomings Mr Thornton took the opportunity shortly afterwards and following a lunch break to use a question in cross examination as a means to seek to retrieve the situation. The exchange was as follows: Well, you don't point us to any other instance of his alleged poor performance at any time than 9 December, do you?---Yes, well, I will say one thing, which was in relation to this $250,000, point six, which is made on the contentions of fact, saying that we had that he just worked that one day and we made $250,000 worth of errors that day. He didn't, but he was working for about two weeks prior in the beamline as a QO man, effectively letting errors go through, I believe, intentionally. When do you say he was working for two weeks in the beamline as a QO man?---You might need to ask Mr Coon exactly, but I spoke to Mr Sathaar at lunch time. He said, ""No, he worked for about two weeks in the beamline as a like a QO person in the same role."" You went and telephoned Mr Sathaar in the lunch break?---Am I not allowed to do that? Well - - -?---Sorry, I didn't realise that was something I wasn't allowed to do. It was explained to you, I think before the before we broke when we broke for lunch by your counsel that you weren't to be having any discussions over the break, wasn't it?---He said I couldn't talk to him. All right, but you thought you were at liberty to go off and speak to Mr Sathaar to find out the situation?---Well, if you want clarity on what happens, isn't that the best thing? 50 Further, the information was obtained over lunch from Mr Sathaar. Mr Thornton said, in effect, that this was the obvious thing to do because Mr Sathaar had the relevant information. And yet Mr Sathaar was not called to give evidence. He was supervising Mr Coon in the job as quality inspector and was present in the yard when, as Mr Thornton alleged, the errors were found. Mr Sathaar was involved in correcting the errors also. Mr Coon denied each of these facts. Mr Thornton also said that he and Mr Sathaar discussed Mr Coon's unsuitability for the job and the reasons for dismissing Mr Coon at the end of his trial period. It can be concluded from the failure of the respondent to call Mr Sathaar that he would not have assisted the respondent's case on these issues: Jones v Dunkel . 51 Another obstacle faced by the respondent in its argument that Mr Coon caused significant cost to the respondent by failing to inspect the steel in the yard properly was that Mr Thornton said that he, his father, and Mr Sathaar had to do the job which Mr Coon had failed to do. If this were so, and they had done the inspection, one would expect that there would have been no faulty steel dispatched on that day. Consequently, there would have been no rectification costs incurred. When faced with this suggestion in cross examination Mr Thornton responded that: ... I'm not sure we rechecked everything. 52 The lack of certainty expressed in this answer is at odds with Mr Thornton's evidence of his extreme level of anxiety arising from the circumstances of the day which Mr Thornton had previously described. 94 Both Mr Sathaar and Mr Thornton's father could have given evidence as to how far away from the meeting they were standing, whether they were checking steel as Mr Thornton said, and whether the speakers were audible to them. Both men were available to the respondent and are in its camp. Their absence from the witness box leads to the conclusion that their evidence would not have assisted the respondent: Jones v Dunkel . 95 I prefer the evidence of Mr Kemmis, Mr Coon and Mr Taylor that Mr Thornton was no more than 30 metres from the meeting. In particular Mr Taylor had a recollection of the location of the management group by reference to a particular door of the plate work factory. This was a level of detail not found in Mr Thornton's recollection. I also accept the evidence of Mr Taylor that the speakers aimed to have Mr Thornton hear what was said and that it was said loudly for Mr Thornton to hear. 96 I find that the evidence positively establishes that Mr Thornton was present within 30 metres of the meeting for the purpose of observing and listening to what was said. I further find that he heard Mr Coon and Mr Kemmis speak at the meeting in favour of union involvement in negotiating a collective agreement with the respondent, and he observed workers at the meeting vote in favour of this course.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.06,0.057,0.883,-0.7882,0.23830000000000018

Case1097,Shipley v Masu Financial Management Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 252,"Masu referred to Shipley v Masu Financial Services Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 252 , but that case is distinguishable for two reasons. The first reason is that Hammerschlag J noted (at [49]) that the argument before him appeared to proceed on the basis that Masu was a ""responsible person"" in relation to the Westpoint Products because it was within the notion of ""either the issuer of the financial product or the person making the offer to sell the financial product"". In the present case, however, Mr Stoyef relies exclusively on s 1012A on the basis that Masu provided financial product advice to Mr Stoyef and the group members, that consisted of or included a recommendation that they acquire the Westpoint Products. Accordingly, the only ""responsible person"" in the present case was the issuer of the Westpoint Product relevant to the particular investor, being either Westpoint or a Westpoint entity. The second reason is that the statement of claim in that case pleaded what a ""proper"" PDS of the kind that the defendant or its authorised representatives was required to give to the plaintiffs would have contained. In the present case, the relevant paragraphs of the further amended statement of claim do not use the word ""proper"" to qualify the PDS that was required to be given. 43 .There are, however, in my opinion, two pleading defects which Masu has identified. First, the words ""at least"" in para 42A are objectionable. Mr Curtin of counsel for Masu, submitted that his client is entitled to know now, rather than at trial, what is all of the particular information that Mr Stoyef says would have been included in the PDS which would have altered his and the group members' minds, because his client would like to investigate, or at least may choose to investigate, the question whether that information was known to ""the responsible person"" referred to in s 1013C(2)(a). 44 I agree. The proposed further amended statement of claim should omit the words ""at least"". If Mr Stoyef later wishes to allege that the hypothetical PDS would have contained further information that would have caused him and the group members not to invest, he will need to seek leave to amend further at that time.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.062,0.021,0.917,0.9468,6.2728

If parties come to realise that they will not necessarily recover the whole of their costs, even though they have unsuccessfully raised a discrete issue, they are likely better to consider whether the raising of that issue is a justifiable course to take. 24 This approach was essentially adopted by Hodgson CJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hodgson CJ, 3 June 1998), where, after discussing the competing considerations of encouraging selectivity of issues and not penalising a party for supporting their case in every reasonable way, his Honour stated at 13: Apart from that consideration, in general terms I accept that if an issue is raised reasonably and is not disproportionate to the whole case, then normally the successful party should get his or her costs. However, particularly in relation to severable issues, the lesser the strength of the point raised and the greater the proportion it bears to the whole case, the more likely it is that the successful party may be deprived of costs; and if the Court comes to the view that it was unreasonable to raise the issue, then the successful party may have to pay the costs of that issue.

Case1102,Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). As a general rule, the successful litigant in a proceeding is entitled to receive its costs ordinarily, costs follow the event. The power to order costs is discretionary, although it must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some good reason connected with the case: Milne v Attorney-General for the State of Tasmania [1956] HCA 48 ; (1956) 95 CLR 460 at 477; Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234; and Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11 per Bray CJ. It is well established that the discretion conferred on the Court is very wide, and enables the Court to respond to the wide variety of circumstances that may arise in relation to the making of costs orders. 13 Justice Toohey said in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) [1986] ATPR 40-748 at 48,136: The discretion [in respect of costs] must of course be exercised judicially. There are decisions, both of Australian and English courts, that throw light on the way in which the discretion is to be exercised. I shall not refer to those decisions in any detail; I shall simply set out in a summary way what I understand to be their effect. 1. Ordinarily, costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order. Ritter v Godfrey [1920] 2 KB 47. 2. Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of his claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that he bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he has failed. Forster v Farquhar [1893] 1 QB 564. 3. A successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other party's costs of them. In this sense, ""issue"" does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or of law. Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 12. There is no difficulty in stating the principles; their application to the facts of a particular case is not always easy. Also it is necessary to keep in mind the caveat by Jacobs J in Cretazzo v Lombardi at 16. His Honour sounded what he described as ""a note of cautious disapproval"" of applications to apportion costs according to the success or failure of one party or the other on the various issues of fact or law which arise in the course of a trial. His Honour commented: ""But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case, including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no two cases are alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded, based merely on his success in those particular issues"".

These observations were approved by Cooper J (with whom Sheppard and Neaves JJ agreed) in Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 602-603. 17 Although, I note that Cooper J, in referring to the above passage of Wilcox J, in the decision of Cummings 41 FCR at 603 said: Wilcox J was of the view that to persist in a denial that the statements as found were made was unreasonable and was conduct which unreasonably prolonged the proceedings. It is no answer to say that a party is entitled to test the evidence to show that nothing was said which might amount to the representations as pleaded. A party always has that right in litigation. However, the question which is relevant to the issue as to costs is whether or not the exercise of that right, or the manner in which it was exercised, was reasonable in all the circumstances; and, whether the exercise of the right had the effect of unreasonably prolonging the proceedings. It was this issue which Wilcox J found against the respondents and upon which he based his decision. 18 There must be some element connected to the proceeding to make it fair and reasonable to deprive a successful litigant of its costs. A good reason not to follow the ordinary rule may arise because of the unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant. It may also arise where there is an ability to identify separate issues or inquiries where the successful litigant has failed. 19 There may be other circumstances in which there needs to be some qualification to the starting point of presuming that the successful party is entitled to its costs where justice requires it. Any determination will always depend on the circumstances arising for the decision of the judge who has conducted the trial and who is considering the appropriate order as to costs. 21 The fact that a successful party has lost on a particular issue or inquiry does not necessarily mean that the party has acted in the litigation inappropriately or unreasonably. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, it may be an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion to apportion costs according to success or failure on a particular distinct or severable issue or inquiry irrespective of any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of the successful party: see Cummings 41 FCR at 599-604; Hughes [1986] ATPR at 48,136.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.17,0.056,0.773,0.999,6.3795
Case1104,Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261,"Considerations of public policy and, in particular, the need for greater economy and efficiency in the conduct of litigation are relevant considerations in the exercise of the discretion when considering whether a successful party is entitled to all its costs: see, e.g. Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) Lane Industries Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 271-272. 47 It is sometimes preferable after apportioning issues as I have done to avoid leaving the quantification and fixing of costs of those issues to taxation. I am mindful that an allocation of costs in the case of a mixed result can rarely be achieved with mathematical precision and such is not necessary: Dodds 26 IPR at 272 per Gummow, French and Hill JJ. Unfortunately, I do not have any appropriate material to estimate the amount of costs or time spent on the preparation and consideration of the economic test prior to trial, and so cannot make any percentage apportionment of the costs to be discounted. I therefore propose to order a deduction in the costs awarded to the NCC by reference to the NCC's points of defence and amended points of defence which will unfortunately leave the quantification and fixing of costs of the economic test issue to taxation in default of agreement between the relevant parties. 48 Therefore, I propose to order as follows: In proceeding number VID 1641 of 2004: 1. The costs of the proceeding be assessed and taxed together with proceeding number WAD 39 of 2005. 2. The applicant pay the first respondent's costs of the proceeding, excluding the first respondent's costs solely of or in connection with the positive contentions stated in paragraph 16 in the first respondent's points of defence dated 8 April 2005 and paragraph 17 in the first respondent's amended points of defence dated 25 September 2006. 3. The applicant pay the second respondent's costs of the proceeding. In proceeding number WAD 39 of 2005: 1.

Case1105,Dr Martens Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602,"The parties were in agreement that I could and should make a global order for costs relating to the proceedings. I am content to proceed on this basis: see Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd (1986) 2 All ER 409 and Dr Martens Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 602. 22 As Goldberg J observed in Dr Martens [2000] FCA 602 at [54] : [A] court should be reluctant to embrace the proposition that, as a general rule, it is appropriate to undertake an enquiry as to who was successful in relation to particular issues in a case to determine whether there should be an apportionment of costs against a successful party. A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue: cf Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Pty Ltd [1991] 1 VR 129 at 152-154. 23 It seems appropriate when considering separate and distinct issues or inquiries, where there is no element of unreasonableness or inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the successful litigant, to consider appropriate case management principles, the relative merits or strengths of the lost issue or inquiry, whether the length of the proceedings had been greatly increased by the lost issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed, and whether the issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed otherwise was of sufficient significance in proportion to the whole case to warrant a special order to deprive that party of the costs of that issue.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.177,0.069,0.755,0.9888,6.3558
Case1106,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203,"It is significant to recall that all parties needed to confront the principal question in the proceedings on the basis there existed only one previous decision of the Court that of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203 (' Hamersley ') which dealt with the interpretation of the term ""use of a production process"" within s 44B of the Act and which involved a very similar factual scenario to the proceedings. Fortescue's principal contention was that, applying the ""marketable commodity"" test to the factual scenario as contended for by Fortescue, a ""marketable commodity"" was produced in BHPBIO's operations before the iron ore was railed to the port. As an alternative contention, Fortescue sought to distinguish Hamersley on a number of grounds. 30 BHPBIO had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately. Nevertheless, BHPBIO was the losing party, and Fortescue would ordinarily be entitled to its costs. However, despite Fortescue's ultimate success in the proceedings, I did not find in favour of Fortescue on certain factual and legal issues or inquiries. Nevertheless, I do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to disentitle Fortescue to its whole costs in the proceedings. 31 The conduct of Fortescue in this proceeding was neither inappropriate nor unreasonable. Fortescue structured its case primarily on the basis of the correctness of the decision in Hamersley . Therefore, it seems to me that seeking to apply the ""marketable commodity"" test as expounded in that decision was an entirely appropriate and reasonable approach. Further, it seems to me that Fortescue seeking in the alternative to distinguish the Hamersley decision on a number of grounds was similarly appropriate and reasonable. In addition, I do not see any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of Fortescue in its approach to putting BHPBIO to proof on factual matters or contentions. The Court accepted in essence the actual process and operations as contended for by BHPBIO. However, the conclusions of the Court were determined objectively and not by reference to BHPBIO's own subjective views or characterisations, or by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of the witnesses called on behalf of BHPBIO. Fortescue was entitled to test the evidence put forward by BHPBIO, especially in respect of such subjective views and characterisations. 32 In Hamersley , the learned trial judge held the term ""production process"" meant ""a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured"": at 213. The test required, as a question of ""fact and degree"", a consideration of ""the actual operation of the activities in question, considered as a whole"": at 213. The evidence as to ""marketable commodity"", whilst it may be separately identified, was all part of the material the Court needed to consider in determining the actual operation of the activities in question. Accordingly, it does not seem unreasonable for Fortescue to have approached in the way it did the material placed before the Court. The principal question for determination in the proceedings was not a mere matter of statutory interpretation of the term ""the use of a production process"" that could be dealt with by demurrer. Rather, the Court was required to consider, in detail, the factual evidence of BHPBIO's operations and apply the construction of the term ""the use of a production process"", whether that construction be the one set out in Hamersley , or the construction for which the Court ultimately found. There does not seem to me to be any element of unreasonableness or inappropriateness in Fortescue directing its evidence, submissions and cross-examination to the application of that test to the facts of this case. 33 This is not the end of the inquiry. As I have indicated, the exercise of the discretion to make an order as to costs is not just limited to a consideration of the reasonableness or appropriateness of the conduct of a party in connection with the proceedings. It may also be appropriate to discount an order in favour of a successful litigant in circumstances where it has lost certain issues or inquiries which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable. 34 At the outset, I do not consider that the matters upon which Fortescue was unsuccessful were relevantly distinct or severable although they can be identified. Rather, the matters on which Fortescue was unsuccessful were alternative arguments in support of the one principal question in the proceedings, that is, whether either of the relevant services was a ""service"" within the meaning of s 44B of the Act. The matters raised by Fortescue were sufficiently linked to this principal question in the proceedings. Fortescue did not seek to raise a separate matter for determination by way of a positive defence. 35 However, to the extent the issues or inquiries upon which Fortescue lost can be identified, and even if they be relevantly distinct and severable, in my view, none of the matters sought to be addressed by Fortescue were so disproportionate to the whole case, or so lacked merit, or so adversely impacted upon the economy and efficiency of the proceedings, according to case management principles, as to warrant an order to deprive Fortescue of some or all of its costs. As I have said, I was required to consider in detail the factual evidence and apply that evidence to the construction of the term ""use of a production process"", which Fortescue reasonably contested. The ultimate ends of justice would not be served by Fortescue not recovering its costs because of its failure on some identifiable (or even distinct and severable) issues or inquiries, when those issues or inquiries needed to be canvassed as being material to the reaching of a decision.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.076,0.034,0.89,0.9857,6.4079500000000005
Case1107,Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 1078,"In Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 1078 , Kenny J considered the apportionment of costs and reduced the costs awarded to the successful applicant to reflect, amongst other things, costs associated with certain affidavit evidence ruled to be inadmissible. 44 Similarly, here, a reduction of costs awarded to NCC would be appropriate in view of my rejection of the economic test. This was an issue which could be treated as clearly distinct and severable, it being in effect a positive contention raised by the NCC in its points of defence and amended points of defence, which had little merit and did add to the costs of preparation of the parties for trial. Whilst I do not have sufficient material to assess such costs, I am satisfied they are not merely minimal. 45 Professor Rey (the economic expert called on behalf of the NCC) and the other economic experts before me agreed that the term ""production process"" had no technical or specialised meaning in economics. In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the economic test could be relevant to the contention that Hamersley was wrongly decided or could provide an appropriate replacement test.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.137,0.037,0.826,0.9602,6.2607

It could sometimes be within the scope of a proper exercise of discretion, where the costs of certain evidence was relevant to issues on which a plaintiff succeeded and also to issues on which the plaintiff failed, to decide to allow the plaintiff a proportion only of those costs. 26 Whilst the cases referred to above throw light on the relevant principles to be applied in the exercise of the discretion, their application to the facts of a particular case is sometimes difficult when competing considerations apply. 27 As I understand the principles relevant to my task, they can be summarised as follows: 1. A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to its costs even if the losing party had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately; 2. The successful litigant will be so entitled to its costs unless some good reason connected to the case is shown to the contrary; 3. Without limiting the general discretion available, a good reason to the contrary may arise: 3.1 Where the conduct of the successful litigant in connection with the case was unreasonable or inappropriate; 3.2 Where no such unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant is found, but nevertheless there were clearly distinct and severable issues or inquiries that were lost by the successful litigant; 4. If the conduct of a successful litigant was inappropriate or unreasonable in connection with the case, the successful litigant will usually be denied all or part of its costs; 5. Where the court is considering the question of costs in respect of a lost distinct or severable issue or inquiry, which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable, then to determine whether the successful party will lose some or all of its costs, it will be necessary to consider and weigh up case management principles, the significance of the issue or inquiry in proportion to the proceeding as a whole, and whether the issue or inquiry had any relative strength or merit; 6. The court has the discretion to apportion costs even if it cannot identify separate costs in respect of distinct or severable issues or inquiries on which the successful litigant failed, but the matters on which the party failed must be at least capable of separation from the matters on which the litigant was successful.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.186,0.063,0.751,0.9964,6.3644
Case1115,Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). As a general rule, the successful litigant in a proceeding is entitled to receive its costs ordinarily, costs follow the event. The power to order costs is discretionary, although it must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some good reason connected with the case: Milne v Attorney-General for the State of Tasmania [1956] HCA 48 ; (1956) 95 CLR 460 at 477; Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234; and Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11 per Bray CJ. It is well established that the discretion conferred on the Court is very wide, and enables the Court to respond to the wide variety of circumstances that may arise in relation to the making of costs orders. 14 The ordinary rule applies even though the losing party may have had good legal grounds for its stance and conducted itself reasonably and appropriately: see Ruddock 115 FCR at 235. In exercising its discretion, the court is looking at the matter primarily from the perspective of the successful litigant: see Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 542-3 per Mason CJ; 564 per McHugh J. 20 However, it is to be observed that ordinarily a discount is applied, or said to apply, because of the inappropriate or unreasonable conduct of the successful party: see Ruddock 115 FCR at 236-237 and Latoudis 170 CLR at 544 per Mason CJ; 565-566 per Toohey J.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.108,0.019,0.873,0.9733,6.317550000000001
Case1116,Health &amp; Life Care Ltd v SA Asset Management Corp [1995] SASC 5514 ; (1995) 18 ACSR 153,"In Health &amp; Life Care Ltd v SA Asset Management Corp [1995] SASC 5514 ; (1995) 18 ACSR 153 , the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia dealt with the question of construction of reg 5.6.24 and the principles of election relating to the surrender of a security by a secured creditor. Doyle CJ (with whom Duggan and Nyland JJ agreed) said at 158 that: ...reg 5.6.24(3) refers to a creditor who has voted in respect of his or her whole debt or claim...When a vote is taken on the voices or by a show of hands each creditor who votes does so simply in the capacity of a creditor. The Chief Justice went on to say that in his opinion: ...it cannot be said that a creditor who votes on the voices (or by a show of hands) votes in respect of the value of the debt or claim. 20 It is plain on the evidence before me that this is what occurred in the present case. It follows from what Doyle CJ said that the provisions of reg 5.6.24(3) were not enlivened. This regulation contains a statement of one situation in which a secured creditor is deemed to have surrendered his or her security. However, as I have said, that provision is not enlivened in the present case and it is unnecessary to further consider this issue. 22 Doyle CJ in Health &amp; Life Care went on at 162 to explain the relationship between reg 5.6.24 and the provisions of s 554E of the Act.

Case1118,Sargent v ASL Developments Limited [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634,"On 16 May, during the course of oral argument, counsel appearing for the liquidator of Kelso raised the possibility that the actions of Provident may be seen to amount to an unequivocal election to surrender its security pursuant to s 554E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Sargent v ASL Developments Limited [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634. 4 I will set out the relevant legislative provisions which are as follows: Section 554E Proof of debt by secured creditor (1) In the winding up of an insolvent company, a secured creditor is not entitled to prove the whole or a part of the secured debt otherwise than in accordance with this section and with any other provisions of this Act or the regulations that are applicable to proving the debt. (2) The creditor's proof of debt must be in writing. (3) If the creditor surrenders the security to the liquidator for the benefit of creditors generally, the creditor may prove for the whole of the amount of the secured debt. (4) If the creditor realises the security, the creditor may prove for any balance due after deducting the net amount realised, unless the liquidator is not satisfied that the realisation has been effected in good faith and in a proper manner. (5) If the creditor has not realised or surrendered the security, the creditor may: (a) estimate its value; and (b) prove for the balance due after deducting the value so estimated. (6) If subsection (5) applies, the proof of debt must include particulars of the security and the creditor's estimate of its value. Regulation 5.6.24 Votes of secured creditors (1) For the purposes of voting, a secured creditor must state in the creditor's proof of debt or claim: (a) the particulars of his or her security; and (b) the date when it was given; and (c) the creditor's estimate of the value of the security; unless he or she surrenders the security. (2) A creditor is entitled to vote only in respect of the balance, if any, due to him or her after deducting the value of his or her security as estimated by him or her in accordance with regulation 5.6.41. (3) If a secured creditor votes in respect of his or her whole debt or claim, the creditor must be taken to have surrendered his or her security unless the Court on application is satisfied that the omission to value the security has arisen from inadvertence. (4) This regulation does not apply to: (a) a meeting of creditors convened under Part 5.3A of the Act; or (b) a meeting held under a deed of company arrangement. 5 The facts may be stated briefly. Provident entered into a deed of charge with Kelso on 2 August 2001. The charge is a fixed and floating charge and was registered on 9 August 2001. Kelso owned a factory and land situated at Wentworthville. That property was subject to Provident's charge. 22 Doyle CJ in Health &amp; Life Care went on at 162 to explain the relationship between reg 5.6.24 and the provisions of s 554E of the Act. It is evident that even if the provisions of the regulations are not applicable, there may nonetheless amount to conduct on the part of a secured creditor which would constitute an election within the principles stated in Sargent v ASL . 24 Dutney J referred to the well-know statement of principle of Stephen J in Sargent v ASL where Stephen J observed that: The words or conduct ordinarily required to constitute an election must be unequivocal in the sense that [the words or conduct are] consistent only with the exercise of one of the two sets of rights and inconsistent with the exercise of the other. Stephen JA also observed that there may be less unequivocal conduct which may provide some evidence of an election and that this may be sufficient if it is coupled with actual knowledge of the right of election. 26 The effect of the reasoning in Surfers Paradise Investments seems to be that something more than the mere submission of the proof of debt is required to constitute an election in the sense referred to in Sargent v ASL . In Surfers Paradise Investments the Queensland Court of Appeal was of the view that there was an election because the receipt of the dividend cheque was unequivocal. At that point in time, as Dutney J observed at [37], the respondent was required to make a choice between accepting the cheque or returning it to the liquidator. The assertion of a right to retain the dividend evidenced by banking the cheque and retaining the proceeds was sufficient to constitute unequivocal conduct amounting to an election.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.11,0.052,0.839,0.9956,6.429600000000001

In that case the respondent was a secured creditor who lodged a proof of debt for the full amount of the debt, disclosing a mortgage, but attributing no value to it. Subsequently the secured creditor received from the liquidator a dividend cheque which it banked and retained. The dividend was calculated on that basis of the full amount of the appellant's total indebtedness. The lead judgment was delivered by Dutney J, but there is also a useful statement of the applicable principles in the judgment of Williams JA.

Case1127,"Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA","In summary, the applicant submits that the AAT misapplied the term ""own use or benefit"" within the context of s 8(1). In particular: &#8226; The phrase does not call for an assessment as to whether a person can in fact use the earnings as they wish or benefit from the earnings in an absolute sense. &#8226; The fact that the money may be earmarked to meet a particular obligation does not detract from the fact that the money is for the person's own use or benefit: Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA. &#8226; The fact that the repayments were made in respect of tasks performed by the respondent and made to the same entity who paid her wages seems to have clouded the issue. The situation is analogous to an employee who is found liable to the employer for damages for negligence arising out of the employee's actions in the workplace: even if the damages awarded were deducted from wages of the employee it could not be said that the employee's earnings were the lesser sum after the deduction of the damages award. &#8226; The circumstances surrounding the payment by the respondent and later reimbursement of $1,300 highlights the error in the AAT's approach. &#8226; The AAT appears to have been influenced by the fact that the applicant was unable to identify a benefit to the respondent from the amounts of the shortfalls. This is clearly an irrelevant consideration as the Act provides for the alternative of ""use or benefit"". The respondent in this case clearly used the amounts to meet her obligations. In any event the respondent did benefit from such amounts in that her superannuation entitlements were calculated on the basis of her gross earnings without deduction for the shortfalls as was apparent from the Employee Payment Summary provided by her employer. 14 In summary, the respondent submitted: 1. So-called questions of law 1, 5 and 6 specified in the notice of appeal are not, in fact, questions of law. 2. The AAT correctly recognised that the key question is whether the whole of the respondent's nominal gross wages can be said to be ""income"" as that term is defined for the purposes of s 8 of the Act . Expressed alternatively, could the amount of the withheld shortfall be said to be earned, derived or received by her for her own use or benefit? 3. The phrase ""for the person's own use or benefit"" entails the notion of a person being able to use property or income as the person wishes or sees fit, as opposed to being obliged to apply the property or income in a particular way. The respondent was never able, at the time of earning, derivation or (constructive) receipt to use the whole of her nominal gross wage as she wished or saw fit. Rather, to the extent of any shortfall, her employer was contractually entitled to withhold the amount of that shortfall from that gross wage and the respondent was obliged to accept that such an amount could be so withheld. 4. The words ""without any reduction"" which appear in s 1072 of the Act qualify only ""income"" as defined, namely the income earned, derived or received for the person's own use or benefit . 5. Reference by the applicant to the sum of $1,300 later received by the respondent by way of refund from her employer is a distraction as the appeal is unconcerned with that sum, although it will be relevant in any recalculation by the applicant of the amount, if any, of any overpayment of benefit. In any event, the AAT correctly regarded that sum as ""ordinary income"" for the purposes of the Act . 15 Appeals from the AAT are not appeals in the strict sense as they lie within the original jurisdiction of the Court. A party to a proceeding before the AAT may appeal to the Court from any decision of the AAT in that proceeding, but only on questions of law: s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 47 It is for the same reason that I find distinguishable from these facts the decision in Kear [1998] 1087 FCA where Heerey J held that the relevant money received by the applicant in that case was ""his own money to deal with as he saw fit"" notwithstanding that the applicant had other commitments or arrangements for which that money was earmarked.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.065,0.026,0.909,0.9674,6.346900000000001

How he chose to organize his life and expenditure during the period of the part-time course was entirely a matter for him... One can readily imagine a case of an allowance entitlement to receive which was dependent upon its expenditure for specified purposes, unrelated to the ordinary incidents of life, so as to entail the conclusion that either the whole of it, or some proportion of it, could not fairly be regarded as a net receipt 'for his own use and benefit' , within the meaning which the Full Court in Haldane-Stevenson's case ascribed to the definition..."" (emphasis added) 46 A strong analogy can be drawn between the case before me and the case hypothesised by Burchett J in Marsh 12 FCR 100 - namely circumstances where income received is subject to the requirement of expenditure for certain purposes.

Case1131,Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57,"The AAT affirmed the decision of the SSAT. Deputy President Hack in the AAT identified the key issue as whether a contractual obligation on the part of an employee to make good till shortfalls should be taken into account in determining the employee's income from that employment. It is useful to set out in full relevant observations from the AAT decision: ""[19] As it seems to me, the critical issue for determination is whether Ms Richards ordinary income was the nominal amount calculated by reference to a number of hours at an hourly rate or the actual rate that is the nominal amount less any shortfall that Ms Richards had to make good. In my view the employment contract between Ms Richards and the Hotel was one where Ms Richards' wages were determined by reference to three factors - the number of hours worked in a week, an hourly rate and any till shortages. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether it was lawful for the employer to oblige Ms Richards to make good the shortfall, rather the question is whether in circumstances where she did make good the shortfall her gross ordinary income was the nominal amount or the actual amount. [20] In Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35 at page 42 French J said, ""The definitions of 'income' and 'income amount' in the Social Security Act indicate that like their statutory predecessors they are of wide application. This meets the public policy requirement that 'public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide' - Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 (Brennan J)."" His Honour went on to make the point that the concept of income in the Act is entirely different from that embodied in the comparable provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . ... [21] At pages 43-44 his Honour said, ""The definition of 'income' extends to income amounts 'received' by a person. There is no requirement in the Act that such amounts are received in exchange for anything. They may therefore extend to gifts. This is reinforced by the extension of the definition of 'income' to 'a periodical payment by way of gift or allowance.' There is no requirement in the definition for the payment received to constitute a net gain. Absent such a requirement a payment of money received by a person for that person's own use or benefit is a payment of an income amount."" [22] In my view the key to the present issue is to ask whether the amounts that went to making up the shortfall in the till were amounts that were received to Ms Richards' own use or benefit. That is so I consider because the definition of gross ordinary income in s 1072 of the Act incorporates the s 8 definition of income relevantly an amount earned, derived or received by a person for the person's own use or benefit. Thus s 1072 looks at income earned, derived or received for the use or benefit of the person in issue. It is in my view not to the point that s 1072 goes on to speak of 'without any reduction.' To treat the amounts of shortfall in this way simply recognises the reality that those sums were not received by Ms Richards for her own use or benefit. There was at best a nominal receipt but given that Ms Richards used those sums to satisfy her contractual obligation to make good shortfalls it could not be said that in any real sense she earned, derived or received those sums or that she had the use or benefit of them. [23] The Secretary was unable to identify any benefit to Ms Richards from these amounts beyond the benefit of retaining her employment. I do not think, with respect, that that could be seen as a benefit of the type contemplated by the definition of income in s 8. [24] It follows that in my view the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was correct and ought to be affirmed."" 32 Third, the concept of ""income"" under the Act is broad. As Brennan J observed in Read v The Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 in relation to the definition of ""income"" under the Social Security Act 1947 (Cth) (which in the context of the proceedings before me is not materially different to the definition of income in s 8 of the Act): ""The definition is exhaustive: the term 'income' means what it is defined to mean; it does not mean what 'income' would be understood to mean if the definition were not in the Act. The definition is couched in the widest terms, presumably to ensure that public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide."" (I note that Brennan J was in dissent in his judgment in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57. However, like Foster J in Secretary to the Department of Social Security v Cuneen [1997] 1033 FCA, I do not read the other judgments in Read [1988] HCA 26 ; 167 CLR 57 as differing from Brennan J's construction of the meaning of ""income""). 34 In relation to the concept of income being ""earned, derived or received"", it is clear that: &#8226; the use of the verbs ""earned"", ""derived"" and ""received"" in juxtaposition in the definition of ""income"" in the Act suggests that each was intended to have a different meaning: Sheppard J in Inguanti v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 80 ALR 307 at 311 &#8226; income cannot be ""earned, derived or received"" unless it is also realised: Read 167 CLR per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ at 67 &#8226; income can be realised - and hence received - even if temporarily it is not accessible: Rose 21 FCR at 245 &#8226; income can be ""derived"" within the meaning of s 8(1) even if it is not at that time received ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 311) &#8226; ""earned"" relates to personal earnings and profits ( Inguanti 80 ALR at 310). 44 Fifth, in interpreting the phrase ""own use or benefit"" it is clear that the obligation of the respondent in this case can be contrasted, for example, with payments made by a person as a result of arrangements otherwise within his or her control, such as outgoings on residential properties of the person which constitute an expense in generating rental income on those properties. As pointed out by the Full Court in Garvey 22 FCR at 136 in relation to such circumstances, ""It was not the purpose of the Act to provide a further source of income for a person who had applied his or her income to maintain a business conducted at a loss or upon outgoings incurred in acquiring or maintaining assets.

Case1136,"Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35","The AAT affirmed the decision of the SSAT. Deputy President Hack in the AAT identified the key issue as whether a contractual obligation on the part of an employee to make good till shortfalls should be taken into account in determining the employee's income from that employment. It is useful to set out in full relevant observations from the AAT decision: ""[19] As it seems to me, the critical issue for determination is whether Ms Richards ordinary income was the nominal amount calculated by reference to a number of hours at an hourly rate or the actual rate that is the nominal amount less any shortfall that Ms Richards had to make good. In my view the employment contract between Ms Richards and the Hotel was one where Ms Richards' wages were determined by reference to three factors - the number of hours worked in a week, an hourly rate and any till shortages. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether it was lawful for the employer to oblige Ms Richards to make good the shortfall, rather the question is whether in circumstances where she did make good the shortfall her gross ordinary income was the nominal amount or the actual amount. [20] In Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1997) 81 FCR 35 at page 42 French J said, ""The definitions of 'income' and 'income amount' in the Social Security Act indicate that like their statutory predecessors they are of wide application. This meets the public policy requirement that 'public expenditure is directed to those who stand in actual need of the periodic support which income-related pensions provide' - Read v Commonwealth [1988] HCA 26 ; (1988) 167 CLR 57 at 69 (Brennan J)."" His Honour went on to make the point that the concept of income in the Act is entirely different from that embodied in the comparable provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . ... [21] At pages 43-44 his Honour said, ""The definition of 'income' extends to income amounts 'received' by a person. There is no requirement in the Act that such amounts are received in exchange for anything. They may therefore extend to gifts. This is reinforced by the extension of the definition of 'income' to 'a periodical payment by way of gift or allowance.' There is no requirement in the definition for the payment received to constitute a net gain. Absent such a requirement a payment of money received by a person for that person's own use or benefit is a payment of an income amount."" [22] In my view the key to the present issue is to ask whether the amounts that went to making up the shortfall in the till were amounts that were received to Ms Richards' own use or benefit. That is so I consider because the definition of gross ordinary income in s 1072 of the Act incorporates the s 8 definition of income relevantly an amount earned, derived or received by a person for the person's own use or benefit. Thus s 1072 looks at income earned, derived or received for the use or benefit of the person in issue. It is in my view not to the point that s 1072 goes on to speak of 'without any reduction.' To treat the amounts of shortfall in this way simply recognises the reality that those sums were not received by Ms Richards for her own use or benefit. There was at best a nominal receipt but given that Ms Richards used those sums to satisfy her contractual obligation to make good shortfalls it could not be said that in any real sense she earned, derived or received those sums or that she had the use or benefit of them. [23] The Secretary was unable to identify any benefit to Ms Richards from these amounts beyond the benefit of retaining her employment. I do not think, with respect, that that could be seen as a benefit of the type contemplated by the definition of income in s 8. [24] It follows that in my view the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was correct and ought to be affirmed."" 48 Finally, in my view a construction of the phrase which would characterise moneys required to be repaid to the employer as being for the employee's ""own use and benefit"" is at odds with the purpose of the Act to maintain a basic level of income for those who are unable to receive sufficient income to provide for themselves ( Garvey 22 FCR at 136, Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin (1998) 81 FCR 35 at 42). Such an arrangement means that the money paid by the employee to the employer is not actually usable by the employee as income, and cannot be taken into consideration in any realistic way in maintaining a basic level of income for the employee. Contrary to the submissions of the applicant, I do not find the reporting by the Hotel for superannuation purposes helpful in this context. Secretary, Department of Social Security v McLaughlin 49 The applicant relied in its submissions on the decision of French J in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35. In that case the respondents, who had carried on business as milk vendors for a number of years, received $121,950 from the Western Australian Dairy Industry Authority under an industry deregulation scheme, in consideration for an undertaking of the respondents to have no involvement in the milk distribution or milk vending businesses in Western Australia for three years. The AAT found on the facts that the arrangement was for the Authority to pay the principal sum to the respondents without any intention that the respondents repay the money, but subject to a contractual term in the event of a breach of covenant giving the Authority the discretion to recover a similar amount. French J held that the amounts received by the respondents were ""income"" within the Act, notwithstanding that they had been not been received in exchange for anything; further his Honour accepted that the amounts had been received for the respondents' own use or benefit (at 44). However in my view the facts of the case before me are distinguishable from McLaughlin 81 FCR 35, in that: &#8226; whereas the income in fact earned, derived or received by the respondent in these proceedings was determined by reference to, inter alia , till shortfalls - &#8226; in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 the power of the Authority to demand repayment of the amount paid to the respondents would appear to have required a determination that there had in fact been a breach of a term of the contract by the respondents; further the terms of the agreement between the Authority and the respondent stated that, if the Authority did not seek repayment by the respondents before a certain time, the respondents were not liable to repay any amounts paid by the Authority. Other than the provision with respect to possible breach of contract, there appeared to be no limitation on the entitlement of the respondents to deal with the moneys paid by the Authority as they chose. 50 In identifying whether amounts received are for the ""own use and benefit"" of the recipient, there is in my view a substantial difference between: &#8226; the obligation of the respondent to ""make good"" till shortfalls (however incurred) arising in the course of her employment, which in turn determines the income of the respondent, as was the case here, and &#8226; the contractual power of the Authority in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 to demand repayment of paid amounts being limited to a period of time, and dependent upon a breach by the respondents of any terms of the agreement, but which power depended upon identification of such ""breach"" having taken place as a matter of contract law. 51 Accordingly, contrary to the submissions of the applicant I do not find the decision in McLaughlin 81 FCR 35 helpful in identifying whether moneys received by respondent in the case before me were for her ""own use and benefit"". $1,300 TAB till shortfall 52 The applicant also submitted that the circumstances surrounding the repayment by the respondent to the Hotel of a till shortfall of $1,300 and subsequent reimbursement of that sum by the Hotel highlights the error in the Tribunal's approach. However in my view it is clear that if moneys representing TAB till shortfalls are paid by the employee to the employer, but subsequently refunded to the employee - as occurred in relation to the $1,300 the subject of the fraud perpetrated on the Hotel - it is at the point they are refunded to the employee that they become income amounts for the own use and benefit of the employee. In those circumstances where the employee is in receipt of Centrelink benefits the employee at that point is required to advise Centrelink of the receipt of that income, because it is only at that point that the money becomes income for the employee's ""own use and benefit"" within the meaning of the Act. I find no error in the reasoning of Deputy President Hack in relation to this issue. 53 In light of my findings in this case the appropriate order is that the appeal be dismissed.

Case1139,"Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415","The applicant submitted that the AAT had erred in ignoring the words ""gross"" and ""from all sources"", and had (in error) focused in isolation on the s 8(1) definition of ""income"". However no error was demonstrated by the AAT's approach. As I have held, the threshold issue in relation to identifying ordinary income is determining whether it is actually "" income "" within the meaning of the Act . Once income is identified, ordinary income can be calculated in accordance with s 1072 by reference to the gross income from all sources for the relevant period without reduction other than reduction under Div 1A of the Act . Expressed another way, the adjective ""gross"" applies to income once it is identified as income. An example of the application of this principle is in Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 where Finn J considered whether payments received by the applicant in that case under an income protection policy bore the character of ordinary income of the applicant's business so as to allow the reduction for losses and outgoings permitted by Div 1A. In that case his Honour, correctly in my opinion, accepted the submissions of the parties that the relevant moneys in that case were ""income"" within the meaning of the Act . Similarly in this case, the first question is whether the moneys received in this case, in particular the moneys repaid by the respondent to the applicant, actually constitute ""income"" within the meaning of s 8(1). 28 This question was clearly viewed by the SSAT and the AAT as the key issue in this case. Indeed in considering whether the respondent's ordinary income included these sums, the question may be recharacterised as whether the sums subsequently repaid by the respondent to the Hotel in respect of TAB till shortfalls constituted income amounts earned, derived or received by the respondent for her own use or benefit. In this respect, as I indicated earlier in this judgment, this question subsumes question of law 4 posed by the applicant, and I will consider both questions of law 3 and 4 together. ""Income"" under the Act : general principles 29 In considering the meaning of ""income"" as defined by the Act , a number of propositions are clear.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.076,0.053,0.871,0.8032,5.7882

There is then no objection to the use of the phrase ""serious question"" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham . 71 However, a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that, provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is not frivolous or vexatious, then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient. The critical statement by his Lordship is ""[t]he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried"" [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 407]. That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 408]: So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial, the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought. (Emphasis added.) Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed. They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought. 72 The second of these matters, the reference to practical consequences, is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application [See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535-536 and the article by Sofronoff, "" Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect "", Australian Law Journal, vol 61 (1987) 341.95].

There is then no objection to the use of the phrase ""serious question"" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham . 71 However, a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that, provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is not frivolous or vexatious, then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient. The critical statement by his Lordship is ""[t]he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried"" [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 407]. That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 408]: So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial, the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought. (Emphasis added.) Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed. They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought. 72 The second of these matters, the reference to practical consequences, is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application [See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535-536 and the article by Sofronoff, "" Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect "", Australian Law Journal, vol 61 (1987) 341.95]. The first consideration mentioned in Beecham , the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff, redirects attention to the present appeal.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.102,0.032,0.866,0.995,6.4125

Case1145,Conagra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302,"The tort of passing off is notoriously difficult to define. A Full Court of this Court in Conagra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 explained the history, meaning and current relevance of the tort. At 355.8 356.2, Gummow J said: In Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc [1990] UKHL 12 ; [1990] RPC 341 at 406, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton formulated the essential elements in a passing-off action without referring specifically to earlier authority. Now, Nourse LJ (in Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v Marks and Spencer plc [1991] RPC 351 at 368-369) has said that the formulations by Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser had not in his experience given the same degree of assistance in analysis and decision as ""the classical trinity"" of (1) reputation (2) misrepresentation and (3) damage. Nourse LJ regards what was said in the Borden case (supra) as signalling a ""welcome return to the classical approach"". It is neither necessary nor appropriate for us to comment upon these vicissitudes of the recent English case law. But it is to be observed that the law of passing off contains sufficient nooks and crannies to make it difficult to formulate any satisfactory definition in short form. However, ""the classical trinity"" does serve to emphasise three core concepts in this area of the law. This appeal is concerned with all of them, namely, the geographical requirements for a sufficient reputation, the nature of the interests damaged, and the significance of fraud in the making of the misrepresentation. 166 More recently, in Hansen Beverage Co v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 , another Full Court of this Court said (at [34] to [37]): 34 In order to succeed in a passing off action, an applicant must establish, as one element of tort existing as at the date when the conduct commenced, that the applicant had the requisite reputation in the name or goods in the jurisdiction of the respondent and that there is a likelihood of deception among consumers or potential consumers resulting from the respondent's actions. An applicant must prove that there are, within the relevant jurisdiction, a substantial number of persons who were aware of the applicant's name or product and are possible consumers. It is necessary to show in a practical and business sense a sufficient reputation in the forum and this requires an evaluation of the size and distribution of the population of prospective consumers likely to be affected: see ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 159 ; (1992) 33 FCR 302 at 342, 343, 346 (per Lockhart J), and 380 (per French J). 35 The tort of passing off is designed to protect the property and goodwill of a business. It is only available where an applicant can show goodwill or reputation in relation to the name or get-up of his or her goods or services because they have become distinctive of his goods or services in a particular market. An applicant will succeed where he or she can show that a potential customer is likely to be misled into believing that the respondents' goods are goods of the applicant or are somehow associated with the applicant: see Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Limited v Pub Squash Co Pty Limited (1980) 32 ALR 387 at 393. 36 In Conagra 33 FCR at 381, in relation to a claim under the TPA, French J referred to the expression ""a not insignificant number"" of persons who would be potential customers as being an appropriate criterion. His Honour went on to observe that if the similarity complained of is ""commercially irrelevant"", having regard to the number of people who know of that similarity, then the name or get-up is not misleading or deceptive. 37 In considering the question of reputation, although s 52 of the TPA makes no reference to ""reputation"", decisions under that provision have referred to the need to prove a ""significant"" or ""substantial"" proportion of persons within the relevant market who would be likely to be misled: see 10th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Limited (1987) 79 ALR 299 at 301; National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (2004) 61 IPR 420 at 440; cf .au Domain Administration Ltd v Domain Names Australia Pty Limited [2004] FCA 424 ; (2004) 207 ALR 521 at 529-530.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.058,0.057,0.885,-0.1635,2.4267500000000006

(a) A special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin. However the shape must have a feature that is ""extra"" and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods: Mayne at [67], Remington at [16] and Kenman Kandy at [137]. (b) Non-descriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose. Where features are striking, trade mark use will more readily be found. For example, features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others: All-Fect at [25]. (c) Descriptive features, like descriptive words, make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product. For example, the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance: All-Fect at [25] and Mayne at [61] [62]. (d) Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods, references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark: Mayne at [63]. For example, evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin: Remington at [12] and Mayne at [69]. (e) If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent, it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element. This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark: Kenman Kandy at [162] and Mayne at [69]. (f) Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court, and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point: All-Fect at [35]. (g) Context ""is all important"" and will typically characterise the mark's use as either trade mark use or not: Remington at [19] and Mayne at [60] [62]. 62 As is apparent from the foregoing propositions, a shape mark case may require consideration of different types of features in determining whether the mark is used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act. At one end of the spectrum are shapes or features thereof that are purely functional. The features may have derived substantially from a patented product, such as the S-shaped fence dropper, or go to the usefulness of the product: Remington at [3] and [12]. Cases such as Mayne and Remington show that such features point away from trade mark use. 63 At the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are non-descriptive and non-functional. They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive, thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others. All-Fect and Remington show that non-functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape. A concocted feature will typically be considered non-functional: Kenman Kandy . 64 Finally, there will be cases, such as the present, that fall between the ends of the spectrum. These cases are not black and white. They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.04,0.013,0.946,0.9231,6.200850000000001

Case1148,Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90,"Counsel also submitted that the respondent does not use the shape or appearance of the Titan chair as a trade mark. He submitted that the respondent merely sells the Titan chair in that shape and depicts the shape of the chair in its brochure for the purpose of describing or identifying the product which it sells. He submitted that the shape of the Titan chair does not contain features which are additional to the inherent form of the chair. He relied upon the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; (2000) 100 FCR 90 as supporting the above propositions. 98 In addition, Counsel for the respondent submitted that Sebel had also failed to demonstrate that the Titan chair was deceptively similar to the Sebel trade mark because: (a) There was no evidence of confusion on the part of any person, even though the Titan chairs had been sold in the United Kingdom for over 12 months and in Australia for a month or so; (b) There were many differences between the Titan chair and the Postura chair which would make it inherently unlikely that the two would be confused or that a person would have cause to wonder whether they came from the same source. He pointed to the catalogue of differences between the Postura chair and the Titan chair set out in Mr Holmes' evidence as well as the labelling on the chair itself; (c) There was no foundation for any concern that the Titan chairs were being discounted or unfairly sold at a lower price; and (d) The typical consumer was a purchasing officer within an educational institution who was price conscious and who would pay special attention to the chairs when making his or her purchase decisions and thus would not be confused. 99 Senior Counsel for Sebel put the proposition that consumers would likely be confused and misled into thinking that the Titan chair and the Sebel Postura chair came from the same source (Sebel), given that Sebel has a substantial reputation in Australia in respect of its Postura range of chairs. 138 In Global Brand Marketing Inc v YD Pty Limited (2008) 76 IPR 161 at [62] to [64] (pp 175 176), Sundberg J set out the principles relevant to the use of a shape as a trade mark as follows: 61 The principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out.

They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other. 141 In Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 , a Full Court of this Court had to consider whether the promotion and sale by Remington of Remington's triple headed electric shaver infringed Philips' registered trade marks which comprised two-dimensional depictions of three shaving heads in the shape of an equilateral triangle. One of the issues in that case was whether Remington's activities involved the use of a trade mark as a trade mark in relation to goods. In the circumstances of that case, the Court held that Remington's promotion and sale of its triple headed electric shaver did not constitute trade mark use. 142 In the course of dealing with these questions, Burchett J (with whom Hill and Branson JJ agreed), said ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 at [11] and [12] (pp 100 101)): 11 A trade mark is defined in the Trade Marks Act 1995 by s 17 as ""a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person"". When that definition -- which accords with the basal doctrine of trade mark law: see the passage from the United States Supreme Court decision Estate of P D Beckwith, Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1920) 252 US 538 at 543 which is cited in Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 -- is required to be applied, regard should be had to a so-called inclusive definition of the word ""sign"" which is to be found in s 6: the word ""includes the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent"". Insofar as it is the use of a trade mark in relation to goods with which the Act is concerned, regard must be had also to s 7(4), by which it is provided: ""In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods)."" The nature of the primary right conferred by the registration of a trade mark is stated in quite summary terms in s 20(1): ""If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: (a) to use the trade mark; and (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered."" It will be observed that this subsection follows the practice, to which Kitto J alluded in Shell Co of Australia Ltd , of omitting to specify that the exclusive right of use is a right to use as a trade mark; however, having regard to the legislative history and the unvarying course of authority, the right must be understood to be so limited. In any case, and somewhat inconsistently, Parliament did decide to specify the nature of the use involved when it came to deal with the subject of infringement. Section 120 provides: ""(1) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to: (a) goods of the same description as that of goods (registered goods) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or ."" (Emphasis added in subs (1) and in the opening part of subs (2).) 12 In my opinion, merely to produce and deal in goods having the shape, being a functional shape, of something depicted by a trade mark (here the marks do depict, one more completely than the other, a working part of a triple rotary shaver) is not to engage in a ""use"" of the mark ""upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods"" within s 7(4), or to ""use"" it ""in relation to the goods"" within s 20(1). ""Use"" and ""use"", in those contexts, convey the idea of employing the mark, (first) as something that can be ""upon"" or serve in a ""relation"" to the goods, (and secondly) so as to fulfil a purpose, being the purpose of conveying information about their commercial origin. The mark is added, as something distinct from the goods. It may be closely bound up with the goods, as when it is written upon them, or stamped into them, or moulded onto them (see Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 , or, in the case of a liquid, it may be sold in a container so formed as to constitute at once both container and mark. But in none of these cases is the mark devoid of a separate identity from that of the goods. The alternative ways of using a trade mark in relation to goods do not include simply using the goods themselves as the trade mark. The reason is plain: it is to be assumed that goods in the market are useful, and if they are useful, other traders may legitimately wish to produce similar goods (unless, of course, there are, for the time being, subsisting patent, design or other rights to prevent them from doing so), and it follows that a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish their commercial origin, which is the function of a mark: Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 and 348-349. As Jacob J said of a ""picture mark"" in Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products at 292: ""A picture of an article is equivalent to a description of it -- both convey information. If the picture is simply of an artefact which traders might legitimately wish to manufacture then to my mind it is just like the common word for it and, like the word for it, incapable of distinguishing."" Even if such a mark achieves registration, that does not make the manufacture and sale of similar artefacts into a use of the mark as a trade mark; cf the remarks, quoted above, of Sargant LJ in Edward Young &amp; Co Ld v Grierson Oldham &amp; Co Ld at 579 about the effect of the registration of the word ""port"" in sloping capitals, remarks which seem to me to apply a fortiori. 144 The reasons of the Court in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 make clear that: (a) Very often, the concept of use as a trade mark in relation to goods involves the physical application of the trade mark to the goods (eg by stamping or embossing thereon the manufacturer's name or logo) in order to state the origin of the goods for all to see. However, goods may be distinguished by other visible characteristics which they have (eg their shape or colour); (b) This concept of use as a trade mark usually involves the particular trade mark having an identity which is separate from the goods themselves; (c) Generally speaking, this notion of use does not include simply using the goods themselves as a trade mark because a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish the commercial origin of those goods; (d) A shape which is dictated by the nature of the goods or by the need to achieve some particular technical result or functional outcome cannot operate as a trade mark. In order to function as a trade mark, the shape must be something which is extra or which is added to the inherent form of the particular goods as something distinct which can denote origin. A shape cannot function as a trade mark if it is something that other traders may legitimately wish to use either because it is inherent to the particular goods (ie it is of their nature ) or because it provides some technical or functional benefit to the goods. 145 As I understand Sebel's case, there are features of the shape of the Titan chair which are said by Sebel to constitute the use of that shape as a trade mark in relation to goods (namely, sidechairs moulded from plastic materials). Just exactly what those features are and how that use is said to arise were matters which were not made clear by Sebel at the hearing and are not at all clear to me now. 146 As the evidence presently stands, it seems to me that: (a) The alleged shape trade mark said to have been used by the respondent as a trade mark in relation to the Titan chair is not something which is distinct from the Titan chair but is rather of the essence of that chair; (b) The shape embodied in the Titan chair does not contain one or more features which are extra or additional to those which comprise or involve the functional elements of the Titan chair; (c) The shape is devoid of a separate identity from that of the Titan chair itself; and (d) The concept of using a trade mark in relation to goods does not include simply using the goods themselves as a trade mark. In the present case, the respondent is, at most, using or intending to use the Titan chair itself as the trade mark. 147 For these reasons, I am inclined to think that Sebel has failed to prove, even to a prima facie level, that the respondent has used a shape as a trade mark in relation to goods of the relevant class by reason of its promotion and sale of the Titan chair. 148 However, I am very conscious that I am presently dealing with an interlocutory application. For this reason, I am prepared to assume for the time being (without deciding) that Sebel has proven these matters to the requisite level. 180 These passages were cited and followed in Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 (at [37] to [47] (pp 114 116), especially at [40] (pp 114 115). 181 For these reasons, I am of the view that Sebel has failed to establish a prima facie case of passing off. 182 There are two groups of Trade Practices Act claims.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.03,0.017,0.953,0.9745,6.39775

For example, features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others: All-Fect at [25]. (c) Descriptive features, like descriptive words, make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product. For example, the word COLA or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance: All-Fect at [25] and Mayne at [61] [62]. (d) Where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods, references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark: Mayne at [63]. For example, evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin: Remington at [12] and Mayne at [69]. (e) If a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent, it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element. This may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark: Kenman Kandy at [162] and Mayne at [69]. (f) Whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court, and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point: All-Fect at [35]. (g) Context ""is all important"" and will typically characterise the mark's use as either trade mark use or not: Remington at [19] and Mayne at [60] [62]. 62 As is apparent from the foregoing propositions, a shape mark case may require consideration of different types of features in determining whether the mark is used as a trade mark for the purposes of the Act. At one end of the spectrum are shapes or features thereof that are purely functional. The features may have derived substantially from a patented product, such as the S-shaped fence dropper, or go to the usefulness of the product: Remington at [3] and [12]. Cases such as Mayne and Remington show that such features point away from trade mark use. 63 At the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are non-descriptive and non-functional. They ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive, thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others. All-Fect and Remington show that non-functional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape. A concocted feature will typically be considered non-functional: Kenman Kandy . 64 Finally, there will be cases, such as the present, that fall between the ends of the spectrum. These cases are not black and white. They involve consideration of whether one set of features supersedes, submerges or overwhelms the other. 140 Similar observations were made by Greenwood J in Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited (2008) 166 FCR 312 at [60] to [70] (pp 337 340).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.041,0.018,0.94,0.91,6.159

There are hundreds of ordinary articles of consumption which, although made by different manufacturers and of different quality, closely resemble one another. In some cases this is because the design of a particular article has traditionally, or over a considerable period of time, been accepted as the most suitable for the purpose which the article serves. In some cases indeed no other design would be practicable. In other cases, although the article in question is the product of the invention of a person who is currently trading, the suitability of the design or appearance of the article is such that a market has become established which other manufacturers endeavour to satisfy, as they are entitled to do if no property exists in the design or appearance of the article. In all of these cases, the normal and reasonable way to distinguish one product from another is by marks, brands or labels. If an article is properly labelled so as to show the name of the manufacturer or the source of the article its close resemblance to another article will not mislead an ordinary reasonable member of the public. 178 Mason J (at 210 211) and Brennan J (at 224 226) expressed similar views. 179 The same reasoning would apply to passing off.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.026,0.016,0.958,0.4215,4.465249999999999

The reference to ""restrained"" reflects the fact that unlike this case the Australian Woollen Mills Ltd case was an appeal in an infringement action. The judgment of the likelihood of deception or confusion is a very practical one and what has long been accepted as the proper approach to making that judgment was set out in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd . It requires assessment of the effect of the challenged mark upon the minds of potential customers. Impression or recollection taken away from the point at which the challenged mark is observed will be the basis of any belief about a connection between the new and the old marks. The effect of spoken description must be considered. What confusion or deception may be expected is to be based upon the behaviour of ordinary people. As potential buyers of goods they are not to be credited with high perception or habitual caution. Exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The question ultimately is not susceptible of much discussion (at 659): ""It depends on a combination of visual impression and judicial estimation of the effect likely to be produced in the course of the ordinary conduct of affairs."" 50 In Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd at 594-595, which concerned the 1905 Act, Kitto J set out a number of propositions which have frequently been quoted and applied to the 1955 Act. The essential elements of those propositions continue to apply to the issue of deceptive similarity under the 1995 Act. Applied also to service marks and absent the imposition of an onus upon the applicant they may be restated as follows: (i) To show that a trade mark is deceptively similar to another it is necessary to show a real tangible danger of deception or confusion occurring. A mere possibility is not sufficient. (ii) A trade mark is likely to cause confusion if the result of its use will be that a number of persons are caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products or closely related products and services come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt. It may be interpolated that this is another way of expressing the proposition that the trade mark is likely to cause confusion if there is a real likelihood that some people will wonder or be left in doubt about whether the two sets of products or the products and services in question come from the same source. (iii) In considering whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion all surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration. These include the circumstances in which the marks will be used, the circumstances in which the goods or services will be bought and sold and the character of the probable acquirers of the goods and services. (iv) The rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of the application. (v) The question of deceptive similarity must be considered in respect of all goods or services coming within the specification in the application and in respect of which registration is desired, not only in respect of those goods or services on which it is proposed to immediately use the mark. The question is not limited to whether a particular use will give rise to deception or confusion. It must be based upon what the applicant can do if registration is obtained. In respect of the last proposition, Mason J observed in Berlei Hestia Industries Ltd v Bali Co Inc [1973] HCA 43 ; (1973) 129 CLR 353 at 362: ""the question whether there is a likelihood of confusion is to be answered, not by reference to the manner in which the respondent has used its mark in the past, but by reference to the use to which it can properly put the mark.

Case1153,Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407,"He submitted that, in the present case, the comparison is not a side by side comparison but one based upon imperfect recollection ( Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 415). He further submitted that size and colour were irrelevant to the question of trade mark infringement. 96 Counsel for the respondent submitted that Sebel had failed to show that it had a prima facie case or serious question to be tried. Counsel submitted that no prima facie case had been shown because: (a) The features of Sebel's trade mark encompass nothing more than functional aspects of a one-piece polypropylene chair; (b) It is notorious that shape trade marks are difficult to enforce where their features cover functional aspects of design and the impugned use concerns functionality of the respondent's product; (c) There are substantial differences between the Titan chair and the Postura chair and these differences lead inevitably to the conclusion that they are not substantially identical; and (d) In any event, both the circumstances in which the respective chairs are bought and sold (ie price sensitive consumers making informed and often complex purchase decisions), and the manner in which the Titan chair is marketed and supplied (with the Titan trade mark and logo and Reed's brand), make the suggestion of deceptive similarity very tenuous. 142 In the course of dealing with these questions, Burchett J (with whom Hill and Branson JJ agreed), said ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 876 ; 100 FCR 90 at [11] and [12] (pp 100 101)): 11 A trade mark is defined in the Trade Marks Act 1995 by s 17 as ""a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person"". When that definition -- which accords with the basal doctrine of trade mark law: see the passage from the United States Supreme Court decision Estate of P D Beckwith, Inc v Commissioner of Patents (1920) 252 US 538 at 543 which is cited in Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 -- is required to be applied, regard should be had to a so-called inclusive definition of the word ""sign"" which is to be found in s 6: the word ""includes the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent"". Insofar as it is the use of a trade mark in relation to goods with which the Act is concerned, regard must be had also to s 7(4), by which it is provided: ""In this Act: use of a trade mark in relation to goods means use of the trade mark upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods (including second-hand goods)."" The nature of the primary right conferred by the registration of a trade mark is stated in quite summary terms in s 20(1): ""If a trade mark is registered, the registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to this Part, the exclusive rights: (a) to use the trade mark; and (b) to authorise other persons to use the trade mark; in relation to the goods and/or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered."" It will be observed that this subsection follows the practice, to which Kitto J alluded in Shell Co of Australia Ltd , of omitting to specify that the exclusive right of use is a right to use as a trade mark; however, having regard to the legislative history and the unvarying course of authority, the right must be understood to be so limited. In any case, and somewhat inconsistently, Parliament did decide to specify the nature of the use involved when it came to deal with the subject of infringement. Section 120 provides: ""(1) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to: (a) goods of the same description as that of goods (registered goods) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or ."" (Emphasis added in subs (1) and in the opening part of subs (2).) 12 In my opinion, merely to produce and deal in goods having the shape, being a functional shape, of something depicted by a trade mark (here the marks do depict, one more completely than the other, a working part of a triple rotary shaver) is not to engage in a ""use"" of the mark ""upon, or in physical or other relation to, the goods"" within s 7(4), or to ""use"" it ""in relation to the goods"" within s 20(1). ""Use"" and ""use"", in those contexts, convey the idea of employing the mark, (first) as something that can be ""upon"" or serve in a ""relation"" to the goods, (and secondly) so as to fulfil a purpose, being the purpose of conveying information about their commercial origin. The mark is added, as something distinct from the goods. It may be closely bound up with the goods, as when it is written upon them, or stamped into them, or moulded onto them (see Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd [1999] FCA 1721 ; (1999) 96 FCR 107 , or, in the case of a liquid, it may be sold in a container so formed as to constitute at once both container and mark. But in none of these cases is the mark devoid of a separate identity from that of the goods. The alternative ways of using a trade mark in relation to goods do not include simply using the goods themselves as the trade mark. The reason is plain: it is to be assumed that goods in the market are useful, and if they are useful, other traders may legitimately wish to produce similar goods (unless, of course, there are, for the time being, subsisting patent, design or other rights to prevent them from doing so), and it follows that a mark consisting of nothing more than the goods themselves could not distinguish their commercial origin, which is the function of a mark: Johnson &amp; Johnson at 342 and 348-349. As Jacob J said of a ""picture mark"" in Philips Electronics NV v Remington Consumer Products at 292: ""A picture of an article is equivalent to a description of it -- both convey information. If the picture is simply of an artefact which traders might legitimately wish to manufacture then to my mind it is just like the common word for it and, like the word for it, incapable of distinguishing."" Even if such a mark achieves registration, that does not make the manufacture and sale of similar artefacts into a use of the mark as a trade mark; cf the remarks, quoted above, of Sargant LJ in Edward Young &amp; Co Ld v Grierson Oldham &amp; Co Ld at 579 about the effect of the registration of the word ""port"" in sloping capitals, remarks which seem to me to apply a fortiori. 156 In the present case, the comparison is not a side-by-side comparison but one based upon imperfect recollection ( Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd 109 CLR 407 at 415; see also Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v FS Walton &amp; Co Ltd [1937] HCA 51 ; (1937) 58 CLR 641 at 658). 157 The impression produced in the mind of potential customers which is carried away must be that the challenged trade mark is the same as the registered trade mark. 158 Mr Holmes, on behalf of the respondent, undertook a comparison between the Postura chair and the Titan chair based upon observations which he made. He then produced a catalogue of observable differences between the two chairs in order to negate any question of deceptive similarity between Sebel's trade mark and Reed Furniture's so-called trade mark. Some of these differences are, in my view, barely noticeable. In any event, as Sebel submitted, the approach reflected in Mr Holmes' comparison is not the correct approach to the issue of deceptive similarity.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.042,0.027,0.931,0.9689,6.376150000000001

Statutory provisions can be ""picked up"" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J).

It is the same test that I applied in Priestley . 21 Mr Priestley has not advanced any arguments as to my competence or independence, or the appearance of independence, or of impartiality, that were not advanced in his previous applications. His submission remains based on his contention that neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. That has been dealt with in Priestley . The result is the same under the common law and, if it applied, under s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . In his submission that the requirements in Article 14.1 of the ICCPR must be considered separately by reason of s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act , Mr Priestley has not added to the substance of the grounds for disqualification or recusal that he made previously. 22 It follows that the application that I disqualify myself from determining these proceedings on the fourth ground should be dismissed.

Case1159,Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119,"As was pointed out in Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119 at [22] , s 79 is couched in mandatory terms. The section is addressed to courts exercising federal jurisdiction and is limited to cases to which the State or Territory laws in question are applicable ( Solomons at [23]). 6 It is, as McHugh J observed in Solomons at [37], a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State (or Territory) is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State (or Territory). Statutory provisions can be ""picked up"" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J). There may also be statutory provisions couched in terms which make it impossible for them to be ""picked up"" ( Edensor at [72]-[74] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Solomons at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ). 7 A court exercising federal jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to apply an Act which, upon its proper construction, applies only to State matters ( Solomons at [33] per McHugh J). Justice McHugh commented in Edensor at [141] and affirmed in Solomons at [59] that it is not the literal interpretation of a State Act that determines whether it is applied in Federal Courts but the substance of the Act. The nature of some State and Territory statutes may make them inapplicable to proceedings in the federal jurisdiction. 17 In neither the constitutional challenge nor the substantive proceedings is the Court called upon to interpret or apply a Territory law, but laws of the Commonwealth. Section 79 of the Judiciary Act does not change the meaning of the State or Territory Act that is ""picked up"", nor does it operate to give a State or Territory law a new or extended meaning when it is made applicable in federal jurisdiction ( Edensor at [134] per McHugh J; Solomons at [60] per McHugh J). For these reasons, s 79 of the Judiciary Act does not operate to make s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act applicable to the present proceedings, which involve the application and interpretation of Commonwealth, not Territory, laws.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.023,0.01,0.967,0.3784,4.3114

Case1165,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"Mr Clark's submissions go to the merits of the Tribunal's reasons. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 ( Yusuf ) at [67] [69], McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ made clear that statutory obligations of the present kind require a statement of the administrative tribunal's actual reasons and findings and references to the evidence or other material on which the findings were actually based ( Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; 206 CLR 323 was concerned with s 430 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)). 54 It is not shown that the statement of ""reasons for decision"" provided by the Tribunal did not contain its actual reasons for its decision, did not include its actual findings on material questions of fact, and did not contain a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were actually based. 55 I turn now to the first question relating to s 1184K. According to the amended notice of appeal, Mr Clark relies on the following ground: The Tribunal erred by not taking into account the following relevant matters: i. the unusual unfair or unjust consequences of strict adherence to s 1170(1) in the circumstances of this case; ii. the implication found in s 17(4) that consideration of the total amount of ""periodic compensation payments"" is to be deducted from the ""lump sum compensation"" upon its receipt thereby leaving the appellant in receipt of only one lump sum to the ultimate effect that ""periodic compensation payments"" have not been made; iii. the unintended effect, when considering the objects of the legislation that if the Appellant had received ""compensation affected payments"" and not ""periodic compensation payments"", that the commencement date of the preclusion period would then have commenced on 31 October 2000; iv. the unfairness occasioned by the limitation placed on the Appellant's claim for economic loss compensation after the age of 65 coupled with the requirement that ""periodic compensation payments"" calculated up to the age of 66 were deducted from the appellant's ""lump sum compensation"". 56 In its reasons, the AAT referred to Mr Clark's financial circumstances and health, the fact that he had been legally represented during his settlement negotiations, and that advice had been sought from, and given by, Centrelink. 57 Mr Clark complains that the AAT failed to address the true nature of the ""special circumstances"" on which he relied, namely, that the very provision in s 1170 for a preclusion period worked unjustly in his case. Much of what I have said above in dealing with the first question is relevant to this complaint.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.042,0.045,0.912,-0.3542,1.7603000000000004
Case1166,"Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348","In Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; (2002) 116 FCR 348 ( Chamberlain ), Kiefel J addressed at some length the question of the circumstances that might be ""special"" within s 1184K. In particular, her Honour reviewed earlier cases and noted (at [32]) that two of them, Kertland v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [1999] FCA 1596 ; (1999) 95 FCR 64 and Secretary, Department of Social Security v Smith (1991) 30 FCR 56, were ""unusual"" in that in them ""it could be seen, objectively, that there could not have been a double payment"", so that ""it might be concluded that the statutory assumption operated unjustly"". Her Honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual. 69 In Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 itself, the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement. Nonetheless, her Honour thought that such a factor would be present in many cases and was simply an aspect of the outworking of the formula. Her Honour considered that it could not, by itself, amount to ""special circumstances"". 70 Like Mr Clark, Mrs Chamberlain was elderly. She was aged 60 years when, on 13 January 1999, she suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident. At the time she was in receipt of an age pension and she had previously received a disability support pension. She claimed to have been able and entitled to earn up to $50 per week from teaching music, without her pension entitlement being affected. Her claim was settled for $35,000 plus $4,000 for costs. The parties to the settlement allocated $31,500 to pain and suffering and medical expenses, and $3,500 to loss of earnings and of earning capacity. 71 Mrs Chamberlain had continued to receive the age pension from the time of the accident. At that time, it was ss 1165 and 1166 of the SS Act that provided for the lump sum preclusion period and refund in Mrs Chamberlain's case, and s 1184 of the SS Act that provided for a discretion in the Secretary to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made or not liable to be made if the Secretary should think it appropriate to do so ""in the special circumstances of the case"". Under s 17(3)(a) , the compensation part of the LSP was $17,500. The preclusion period was arrived at by dividing that sum by $422.90, giving a period of 41 weeks. The period ran from the date of the injury, 13 January 1999, to 26 October 1999. The statutory formula produced the result that in respect of that period, Mrs Chamberlain was liable to pay to the Commonwealth $7,643.36 more than twice the sum of $3,500 mentioned above. 72 Kiefel J stated (at [34] [35]): [34] The basis for the Tribunal's view [that ""special circumstances"" were established] was its acceptance of what the parties to the settlement said had been offered and accepted for the economic loss component. It was far less than the statute assumed to be the case in applying the formulae. Again, however, this will be so in many, if not most, cases to which the Act applies. Further, the extent of the difference from the basis upon which the parties acted could not provide the necessary ""special circumstance"". The statute has selected a figure which may operate in an arbitrary way. [35] The statutory objectives in utilising the formulae, referred to above, must also be borne in mind. It is not intended that a decision-maker be required to consider contentions about what part of the compensation reflected the economic loss component. That is so whether one has regard to the application of the formulae or the discretion under s 1184. The latter does not alter the objective and must be read in light of it. 73 Her Honour set aside the Tribunal's decision. 74 If Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 is to be followed, the present application must be dismissed. 75 I respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by Kiefel J. The expression ""special circumstances"" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 76 Once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case, one is defeating the legislative intention. The Parliament must be taken to have contemplated as ""usual"" or ""ordinary"" the circumstances of people placed as Mr Clark is. In effect, by adopting the rough and ready 50 percent rule, the legislature has faced such people with a choice: not sue at all and to rely, instead, on such other entitlements as may be available; litigate to trial so that the Court will identify a figure for loss of earnings and of earning capacity; or settle subject to the operation of the 50 percent rule. 77 In the present case, Mr Clark must be taken to have decided against the former two courses. I do not know why he did so. In one sense, it seems unfair that Mr Clark should suffer a preclusion period until 15 February 2008, but I do not think that this constitutes ""special circumstances"" in the light of the legislative intention. 78 If the position were otherwise, the r&eacute;gime that was introduced in 1988 would be defeated because it would be again open to parties to a settlement to attribute an artificially low figure to loss of earnings and earning capacity, and to the injured person, through s 1184K of the SS Act, to initiate the very kind of investigation that it was the intention of the 1988 amending Act to eliminate. 79 For the above reasons, I do not think that the AAT erred in law in failing to exercise the discretion given by s 1184K of the SS Act.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.05,0.896,0.5269,4.84015
Case1167,"Secretary, Department of Social Security v Banks (1990) 20 ALD 19","It is useful to look at the policy considerations that informed the inclusion of the 50 percent rule in the SS Act. Provisions that were substantially the same as ss 17(3)(a) were introduced by the Social Security Amendment Act 1988 (Cth) (Act No 58 of 1988) . The Second Reading Speech on the Bill set out the reason for the rule (Australia, House of Representatives, Debates (13 April 1988) Vol HR160, p 1497 (Mrs Kelly, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)): This Bill contains measures to improve the administration and integrity of the compensation recovery provisions. Where a person receives personal injury compensation that makes up for lost income the Social Security Act provides that pension or benefit may be reduced or recovered. This is one way in which social security expenditures are directed to those most in need. Settlements of lump sum compensation particularly in the workers compensation jurisdiction are being manipulated to obscure the economic loss component and to avoid recovery of social security payments. To prevent this abuse, the Minister announced on 8 February 1988 that, for future personal injury settlements made by agreement or by consent order, 50 per cent of lump sum compensation will be deemed to be in respect of economic loss. This Bill gives effect to that proposal. It is clear that the policy objective was to prevent manipulation to obscure the economic loss component in compensation payments and instead deem a flat 50 percent in all cases, with a reduced preclusion period to compensate for an RPCP component. In deciding Mr Clark's case, the AAT had regard to this policy, citing the discussion of the amendments and the background to them by von Doussa J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Banks (1990) 20 ALD 19. 42 The construction supported by Mr Clark would itself result in an anomaly in relation to a young person whose loss of earning capacity accounted for a large part of his or her lump sum compensation payment. Assume a settlement for an LSP of $2,000,000, that there was an RPCP of $200,000, and that, although not specified, the sum of $2,000,000 included $1,400,000 for loss of earning capacity. According to the s 17(3) and s 17(4) formulae, the compensation part of the LSP would be only $900,000. On what basis in fairness would the injured young person have a claim to have the preclusion period (calculated by reference to that amount) begin back on the date of the injury, rather than the day after the end of the period covered by the periodical compensation payments of $200,000? The arbitrary figure of $900,000 would already be an understatement of the amount received for loss of earnings and of earning capacity, and to adopt the date of the injury as the start of the preclusion period would only increase the ""over generous"" treatment of the injured young person. In a perfect world, the preclusion period would run from the date of injury until the sum of $1,400,000 was exhausted, and in Mr Clark's case from 31 October 2000 until whatever amount was included in the sum of $280,000 for loss of earnings and of earning capacity was exhausted. But in an imperfect world in which settlement figures were being manipulated so as to understate the component for loss of earnings and of earning capacity, the legislature has solved the problem by the rough and ready 50 percent rule. 43 The provisions reflect a policy decision to treat that which remains after any repayment of any periodic compensation payments as relating, as to 50 percent, to loss of earnings or of earning capacity, in respect of the period after the expiry of the period covered by those payments. The provisions reflect an acceptance by the legislature that it is not practicable to achieve complete justice attuned to the circumstances of each individual case.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.081,0.079,0.84,0.431,4.5065

Case1172,PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2000] HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648,"In substance, Mr Urquhart's case was that: (a) When Powercor contracted out its meter reading function to AMRS in 2002 and 2004, part of Powercor's business (namely, meter reading) was transmitted to AMRS. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract. He argued that Powercor took back this part of its business when the VMM contract terminated and, again, when the Marshmans contract ended. Counsel contended that the Electricity Industry Act 2000 (Vic) (""the Electricity Industry Act ""), the Electricity Distribution Licence, and the numerous regulatory Codes illustrated ""both the essential part metering play[ed] in the distribution of electricity as well as the ongoing obligations of the distributor, regardless of whether or not the task [had] been outsourced"". Counsel argued that, ""[b]y reason of the ... obligations imposed on distributors and conditions of licence meter reading and the related activities undertaken by meter readers [meter reading] was more than an ancillary part of the business of a distributor and [was] in fact a necessary part of the business"". He submitted that whether or not Powercor performed meter reading between the contracts was irrelevant. For the duration of the contract between Powercor and AMRS, AMRS had ""what ... Powercor has within its power to give"". Counsel for Mr Urquhart relied on PP Consultants Pty Ltd v Finance Sector Union of Australia [2000] HCA 59 ; (2000) 201 CLR 648 ("" PP Consultants ""), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194 ("" Gribbles "") and Stellar Call Centres Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2001] FCA 106 ; (2001) 106 FCR 302 ("" Stellar Call Centres ""). He also relied on Construction Forestry Mining &amp; Energy Union v Henry Walker Eltin Contracting Pty Ltd (2001) 108 IR 409 ("" CFMEU v Henry Walker Eltin ""), Minister of State for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business v Community and Public Sector Union [2001] FCA 316 ; (2001) 109 FCR 303 and North Western Health Care Network v Health Services Union of Australia [1999] FCA 897 ; (1999) 92 FCR 477 ("" North Western Health Care ""). (b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). 39 AMRS responded that: (a) Powercor's contracting out of the meter reading function did not constitute a transmission of business as meter reading was not Powercor's business, or part of its business. Rather, meter reading was an ancillary function that supported the core business of Powercor, which was to distribute electricity. AMRS also relied on PP Consultants , Gribbles and Stellar Call Centres . AMRS submitted that meter reading was not an essential, or even significant, part of the business of distributing electricity. Nor was it part of the development or maintenance of the assets used to generate electricity, the use of which enabled a fee to be charged to the retailers. AMRS contended that there was a material difference between the metering of electricity use and the reading of meters. This distinction was apparent in each of the outsourcing contracts and in Powercor's distribution licence. (b) If it were wrong in the above submission, then there was no transmission of business to AMRS in 2002 and 2004 as it had already been transmitted to VMM in 1997. Powercor had not, since that time, ""contracted in"" the meter reading function. Hence, at the time of contracting out meter reading to AMRS, Powercor had no meter reading business left to transmit. Alternatively, there was no transmission because, under Powercor's distribution licence and the relevant Codes, Powercor retained the obligations with respect to meters and meter-reading. Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart). Therefore, Mr Urquhart was not entitled to be paid in accordance with those instruments. AMRS argued that, even if a generous approach was adopted to the interpretation of the 1998 Award, there was nothing in the 1998 Award that imposed a legal obligation on Powercor to classify, or pay, meter readers under the 1998 Award. Moreover, the history did not disclose that that there was any previous agreement or award relevant to the 1998 Award showing that meter readers were to be covered by the award. Neither the 1999 Agreement nor the 2002 Agreement expressly sets out which Powercor employees were to be covered by these agreements. Rather, by reference to Appendix C in the case of the 1999 Agreement and Appendix D in the case of the 2002 Agreement, each instrument sets out rates of pay within the structure of a 30-point pay scale. In the absence of express provision, AMRS contended that it was proper to consider the industrial and statutory context surrounding the Agreements. This required attention to the objective facts. AMRS argued that the translation exercise undertaken within Powercor after the 1997 Agreement was not relevant to the construction question. Even if this exercise could be taken into account in construing the 1999 Agreement, at the time of certification of the 1999 Agreement (and the 2002 Agreement), Powercor did not employ any standard meter readers. AMRS submitted that, in the circumstances, it could not be said that, viewed objectively, the pay point classification scheme in the two agreements was intended to cover standard meter readers. AMRS further argued that its approach was supported by the statutory context surrounding the certification of enterprise agreements. AMRS submitted that clause 8.2.2 of the 1998 Award made it clear that the loading of 25% attached to the rates of pay prescribed in the Award and not the rates in the 1999 or 2002 Agreements. 42 The first critical question is whether, for the purposes of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , AMRS is the transmittee of the business or part of the business of Powercor. Whether there has been transmission (or a succession or assignment), for these purposes, is a mixed question of fact and law. PP Consultants indicates how this question should be considered. 43 According to PP Consultants , as a general rule, in a case such as the present, it is necessary, first, to identify or characterise the business or the relevant part of the business of the first employer; secondly, to identify the character of the transferred business activities in the hands of the new employer; and, thirdly, to compare the two business: see PP Consultants at 655 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. If, in substance, the business of the first employer has the same character as the transferred business activities in the hands of the new employer, then it may be possible to say the business, or a part of the business of the first employer had been transmitted to the new employer. If the business of the first employer does not have the same character as the transferred business activities of the new employer, then there can be no transmission (or succession or assignment). 44 The joint judgment in PP Consultants illustrates this approach. The analysis began with the proposition that St George Bank Ltd was in the business of banking and the activities in which it engaged at its branch at Byron Bay were part of its banking business (at 655). The pharmacist that the Bank appointed to carry on a branch agency after it closed this branch did not engage in the business of banking, although it engaged in banking activities (at 656). The pharmacist was, so their Honours held, carrying on the business of a banking agent. Their Honours said (at 656): All that has happened is that the Bank has changed the method by which it carried on its banking business in Byron Bay. Thus, no part of the Bank's business has been acquired by the [pharmacist], whether as successor, assignee or transmittee. On this approach, the fact that the activities carried on by the old and new employers were the same as far as the employees were concerned was immaterial. 47 Stellar Call Centres applied the reasoning in PP Consultants to an inquiry under ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) (which, for present purposes, is in relevantly the same terms as s 170MB(2)). In the Full Court of this Court, Stellar Call Centres challenged the decision of the judge at first instance that, pursuant to ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) of the Workplace Relations Act , it was bound by awards and certified agreements binding on Telstra Corporation Ltd (""Telstra""). The question was whether a part of Telstra's business that involved the taking and responding to telephone calls from Telstra's customers had been transmitted to Stellar Call Centres. The Full Court held that there was no such transmission, chiefly because the receiving of the calls from customers were ""activities in support of Telstra's businesses in the telecommunication industry"" but were ""not themselves ... the business or part of the business of Telstra"": see Stellar Call Centres at 311. The Full Court said (at 311): That business can appropriately be characterised as providing telecommunications services to its customers. In the course of conducting that business, Telstra is called upon to respond to enquiries, requests for services and complaints from its customers, including those made by telephone. However, the making of those responses is not a distinct 'part' of Telstra's business within the meaning of s 149(1) , as explained by the High Court, any more than, for example, cleaning undertaken as a necessary aspect of the conduct of a restaurant is a 'part' of the business of the restauranteur. The business of Stellar Call Centres was the provision of telephone answering services. The answering of calls was not, however, a part of Telstra's business; and, accordingly, there was no transmission of that part of Telstra's business. 66 In response, counsel for Mr Urquhart argued that ""transmission"" was a non-legal concept and did not depend upon privity or any formal legal transfer of rights between the parties. Moreover, he submitted that the Court should not give weight to the consideration as to whether or not Powercor technically retained rights or obligations with respect to meter reading, because to give weight to this consideration would not reflect commercial reality. He referred to North Western Health Care and Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union v Torrens Transit Services Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1683 ; (2000) 105 FCR 88 , which applied North Western Health Care . Both cases concerned, amongst other things, a transmission of the business of State government or department and, in any event, for the reasons appearing below, since PP Consultants and Gribbles , North Western Health Care can no longer be said reliably to state the law in this area. 68 Although the authors of the joint judgment in PP Consultants decided that case primarily on the basis of the characterisation test referred to earlier, holding that the pharmacy was not engaged in the banking business, they also added (at 656): Moreover, the Bank has not disposed of any part of its business. All that has happened is that the Bank has changed the method by which it carried on its banking business in Byron Bay. Thus, no part of the Bank's business has been acquired by the [pharmacy], whether as successor, assignee or transmittee. In effect, the joint judgment in PP Consultants set out two tests for succession, assignment and transmission a characterisation test (discussed above) and a disposal test. Both tests must be satisfied in order for the operation of the award (under s 149(1)(d)) or the certified agreement (under s 170MB(2)) to be attracted to the new employer. 69 As it happened, in his separate judgment, Callinan J (agreeing with the joint judgment in the result) considered the issue of disposal at greater length than in the joint judgment. After noting considerations that were not dissimilar to those relied on by AMRS, his Honour identified the question that he considered should be asked: see PP Consultants at 664. Adapted to this case, this question is, what 'business', which Powercor is said to have transmitted to AMRS, could AMRS sell or otherwise pass on to someone else? If this is a correct question to ask in connection with transmission, for the reasons stated below, the answer, as in PP Consultants , would be ""no business"". Callinan J's conclusion (at 665) that ""[t]he business of the bank had not 'passed'""; rather ""[a] new form of business was created (by agreement) and was to be carried on by a new operator as an agent"" might also summarise the effect of the 2002 contract. Under the 2002 contract, the business of Powercor did not pass (and was not transmitted). Rather, under the contract, AMRS was to carry on a new business of meter reading for Powercor. 70 The foregoing notwithstanding, I might still be in some doubt as to the correct analysis to be followed had PP Consultants not been succeeded in the High Court by Gribbles . The combined effect of these two decisions is, so it seems to me, to make the relevant state of the law reasonably clear with respect to provisions like ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act . In Gribbles , the High Court confirmed that the characterisation test (identifying the business or part of a business) and the disposal test (determining whether the business or part of a business so characterised was disposed of) are separate and distinct questions. Thus, in their joint judgment in Gribbles , Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ stated (at 213): [T]he need, when considering the application of s 149(1)(d) [is] to do two things. First, it is necessary to identify exactly what is meant in the context of the particular case, by 'the business or part of the business' of the former employer. Secondly, it is necessary to identify what part of that 'business' the former employer once had which is now enjoyed by the person allegedly bound by the award. 73 In this case, unlike Gribbles , there was a direct transaction between the former and the new employers, as expressed in the 2002 contract (and, subsequently, transactions expressed in the 2003 contract and the 2004 contract). Accordingly, this (like PP Consultants ) is one of the ""many cases"" where the answer is to be found by considering the transaction between the former and the new employers. 74 It is worth noting that, in Gribbles , the characterisation test was on the facts of the case easily satisfied in contrast to PP Consultants where it was not satisfied at all: see Gribbles at 214. The majority in Gribbles (at 214-15) thus focussed on the disposal test or, from the new employer's perspective, the enjoyment test, whilst this aspect called for very much less attention in PP Consultants . Considered in this way, PP Consultants and Gribbles are complementary aspects of the overarching question whether there has been a transmission, succession or assignment. 77 The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204. This test is substantially identical to that proposed by Callinan J in PP Consultants (at 664) in that his Honour there asked whether there was anything for the new employer ""to sell or otherwise pass on to someone else"". 80 It might be said that the High Court's analysis of the operation of s 149(1)(d) and like provisions allows employers, in effect, to ""contract out"" of their obligations under awards and certified agreements with comparative ease. In PP Consultants (at 666) Callinan J sought to meet this objection, in the following way: Whilst it may be accepted that a purpose of the provision is to prevent evasion of obligations by employers who do succeed to a business or part thereof, there is another policy consideration which bears on this case. The legislation, it may be inferred requires a common identity of a business or part thereof, into whosoever hands it falls, on the assumption that a successor will have the same and continuing capacity to meet the obligations arising under an award as the former operator of the business. No such assumption may safely be made about a different business. 82 These fundamental differences in perspective and approach have been the subject of scholarly discussions, which have proposed alternative analyses: see, for example, Trent D Sebbens, ""'Wake, O Wake' Transmission of Business Provisions in Outsourcing and Privatisation"" (2003) 16 Australian Journal of Labour Law 133. This Court is, however, bound to follow PP Consultants and Gribbles , which provide a clear answer in this case.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.102,0.033,0.865,0.9998,6.4303

A company called Region Dell Pty Ltd conducted medical clinics, including one at Moorabbin. The company licensed the use of part of the Moorabbin clinic's premises for a radiology practice. The company also supplied the equipment. The radiology practice supplied the radiographers, consumables and the like. The company had granted three such licences the first, to Southern Radiology; the second until 31 August 1999, to MDIG; and the third, from 1 September 1999, to Gribbles. In 2000, Gribbles terminated the employment of the radiographers at Moorabbin. If Gribbles were bound by the Award that had bound MDIG, then Gribbles was bound to pay severance pay to the radiographers. This turned on whether Gribbles was a successor, for the purposes of s 149(1)(d) , to or to any part of the business of MDIG. In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ held that it was not. 46 In the course of this judgment, their Honours touched on the meaning of the word ""business"" in this context. As their Honours said, to be a ""successor"" (or assignee or transmittee), it is not enough that the new employer pursues the same kind of business as the old: Gribbles at 211. What was meant by the word ""business"" in this context depends on s 149(1)(d) , which ""focuses upon succession, assignment and transmission to or of a business which is identified as the business of an employer"", which ""necessarily directs attention to what it is that the former employer had which is to be described as the 'business' of that employer"": Gribbles at 211. Their Honours went on to say (at 212): The 'business' of an employer may be constituted by a number of different assets, both tangible and intangible, that are used in the particular pursuit, whether of profit (if the 'business' is a commercial enterprise) or other ends ... In the case of a commercial enterprise, identifying the employer's 'business' will usually require identification both of the particular activity that is pursued and of the tangible and intangible assets that are used in that pursuit. The 'business' of an employer will be identified as the assets that the employer uses in the pursuit of the particular activity. It is the assets used in that way that can be assigned or transmitted and it is to the assets used in that way that an employer can be a successor. The new employer may be a successor, assignee or transmittee to or of the business, or part of the business, of an employer who was a party to the relevant industrial dispute if the new employer, having the beneficial use of assets which the former employer used in the relevant pursuit, uses those assets in the same or a similar pursuit. ... Whether the new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee, will require examination of whether what the new employer has can be described as a part of the former employer's business. In s 149(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act , ""the business or part of the business"" of the former employer which in the present case is Powercor is thus to be characterised by reference to the particular activity that it pursued and the assets that it used in that pursuit. As Stellar Call Centres shows, whether a new employer ""becomes the ... transmittee ... of the whole or a part of the business concerned"", for the purposes of subs 170MB(2) depends on much the same inquiry. 66 In response, counsel for Mr Urquhart argued that ""transmission"" was a non-legal concept and did not depend upon privity or any formal legal transfer of rights between the parties. Moreover, he submitted that the Court should not give weight to the consideration as to whether or not Powercor technically retained rights or obligations with respect to meter reading, because to give weight to this consideration would not reflect commercial reality. He referred to North Western Health Care and Australian Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union v Torrens Transit Services Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1683 ; (2000) 105 FCR 88 , which applied North Western Health Care . Both cases concerned, amongst other things, a transmission of the business of State government or department and, in any event, for the reasons appearing below, since PP Consultants and Gribbles , North Western Health Care can no longer be said reliably to state the law in this area. 70 The foregoing notwithstanding, I might still be in some doubt as to the correct analysis to be followed had PP Consultants not been succeeded in the High Court by Gribbles . The combined effect of these two decisions is, so it seems to me, to make the relevant state of the law reasonably clear with respect to provisions like ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act . In Gribbles , the High Court confirmed that the characterisation test (identifying the business or part of a business) and the disposal test (determining whether the business or part of a business so characterised was disposed of) are separate and distinct questions.

Secondly, it is necessary to identify what part of that 'business' the former employer once had which is now enjoyed by the person allegedly bound by the award. 71 Before discussing Gribbles further, I would acknowledge that, as counsel for Mr Urquhart observed, Gribbles is distinguishable in at least one respect from this case because Gribbles , in contrast to this case, involved no direct transaction between the former employer and the new employer. That is, Gribbles involved the question whether there had been a ""succession"" by the new employer to the old employer's business, and did not involve a question of ""transmission"": see Gribbles at 203-204 and 208. This distinction does not, however, affect the critical reasoning in Gribbles , as the majority judgment shows. 72 The majority in Gribbles (at 212) acknowledged the distinction, by observing that the answer as to whether there has been an assignment, succession or transmission: ... will be provided by looking at some transaction between the two employers. Where there has been some transaction between them, it will be possible to see whether the former employer transferred the whole, or part, of its business to the new employer. But in other cases there may be no transaction between the former employer and the employer alleged to be its successor ... Thus, the existence of some transaction between the two employers is not essential in order to show that one is the successor to the business of the other. Further, whether or not there was some transaction between the new employer and the former employer, there may be a real question about whether what the new employer enjoys is the whole or a part of the 'business' of the former employer. 73 In this case, unlike Gribbles , there was a direct transaction between the former and the new employers, as expressed in the 2002 contract (and, subsequently, transactions expressed in the 2003 contract and the 2004 contract). Accordingly, this (like PP Consultants ) is one of the ""many cases"" where the answer is to be found by considering the transaction between the former and the new employers. 74 It is worth noting that, in Gribbles , the characterisation test was on the facts of the case easily satisfied in contrast to PP Consultants where it was not satisfied at all: see Gribbles at 214. The majority in Gribbles (at 214-15) thus focussed on the disposal test or, from the new employer's perspective, the enjoyment test, whilst this aspect called for very much less attention in PP Consultants . Considered in this way, PP Consultants and Gribbles are complementary aspects of the overarching question whether there has been a transmission, succession or assignment. 75 Assuming (contrary to the finding above) that the characterisation test is satisfied since meter reading constituted a part of the business of Powercor, the critical question is that presented in Gribbles whether it can be properly said that Powercor disposed of a meter reading business, which is now enjoyed by AMRS. 76 In the present case, there is a degree of artificiality about this inquiry since it fails to take account of the fact that the former employer (Powercor) had entered into similar contracts with VMM and Marshmans immediately before entering into the 2002 contract with AMRS. In this context, if there was a transmission to AMRS, it must be assumed that either similar transmissions to VMM and Marshmans were limited to the duration of their respective contracts or, for some unapparent reason, the transactions between Powercor and VMM and Marshmans were relevantly different, with the consequence that there was no previous transmission. I do not stop to investigate these possibilities further because, in my view, there was no transmission between Powercor and AMRS. The critical question in Gribbles whether it can be said that Powercor disposed of a meter reading business that is now enjoyed by AMRS on the facts as disclosed in the evidence must be answered ""no"". 77 The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204. This test is substantially identical to that proposed by Callinan J in PP Consultants (at 664) in that his Honour there asked whether there was anything for the new employer ""to sell or otherwise pass on to someone else"". 82 These fundamental differences in perspective and approach have been the subject of scholarly discussions, which have proposed alternative analyses: see, for example, Trent D Sebbens, ""'Wake, O Wake' Transmission of Business Provisions in Outsourcing and Privatisation"" (2003) 16 Australian Journal of Labour Law 133. This Court is, however, bound to follow PP Consultants and Gribbles , which provide a clear answer in this case.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.107,0.034,0.859,0.9998,6.4262999999999995
Case1174,"Stellar Call Centres Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal Plumbing and Allied Services Union [2001] FCA 106 ; (2001) 106 FCR 302","In substance, Mr Urquhart's case was that: (a) When Powercor contracted out its meter reading function to AMRS in 2002 and 2004, part of Powercor's business (namely, meter reading) was transmitted to AMRS. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract. He argued that Powercor took back this part of its business when the VMM contract terminated and, again, when the Marshmans contract ended. Counsel contended that the Electricity Industry Act 2000 (Vic) (""the Electricity Industry Act ""), the Electricity Distribution Licence, and the numerous regulatory Codes illustrated ""both the essential part metering play[ed] in the distribution of electricity as well as the ongoing obligations of the distributor, regardless of whether or not the task [had] been outsourced"".

(b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Counsel for Mr Urquhart referred to the 1965 Award, 1969 Variations, the National Wage Cases , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement in support of his submission that, whilst employed by AMRS, Mr Urquhart was entitled to be paid wages and superannuation at the rate for which the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement provided, and not at the rate he was in fact paid by AMRS, but with the loading prescribed by the 1998 Award. He referred to the principles for interpreting awards in various cases, including in City of Wanneroo v Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (2006) 153 IR 426. He contended that, properly construed, the underpayment that Mr Urquhart claimed in his relief (see [4]) included the loading for which the 1998 Award provided calculated by reference to the 1999 and 2002 certified agreement rates (as well as the difference between the amounts for which these certified agreements provided and that which he was actually paid). 39 AMRS responded that: (a) Powercor's contracting out of the meter reading function did not constitute a transmission of business as meter reading was not Powercor's business, or part of its business. Rather, meter reading was an ancillary function that supported the core business of Powercor, which was to distribute electricity. AMRS also relied on PP Consultants , Gribbles and Stellar Call Centres . AMRS submitted that meter reading was not an essential, or even significant, part of the business of distributing electricity. Nor was it part of the development or maintenance of the assets used to generate electricity, the use of which enabled a fee to be charged to the retailers. AMRS contended that there was a material difference between the metering of electricity use and the reading of meters. This distinction was apparent in each of the outsourcing contracts and in Powercor's distribution licence. (b) If it were wrong in the above submission, then there was no transmission of business to AMRS in 2002 and 2004 as it had already been transmitted to VMM in 1997. Powercor had not, since that time, ""contracted in"" the meter reading function. Hence, at the time of contracting out meter reading to AMRS, Powercor had no meter reading business left to transmit. Alternatively, there was no transmission because, under Powercor's distribution licence and the relevant Codes, Powercor retained the obligations with respect to meters and meter-reading. Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart). Therefore, Mr Urquhart was not entitled to be paid in accordance with those instruments. AMRS argued that, even if a generous approach was adopted to the interpretation of the 1998 Award, there was nothing in the 1998 Award that imposed a legal obligation on Powercor to classify, or pay, meter readers under the 1998 Award. Moreover, the history did not disclose that that there was any previous agreement or award relevant to the 1998 Award showing that meter readers were to be covered by the award. Neither the 1999 Agreement nor the 2002 Agreement expressly sets out which Powercor employees were to be covered by these agreements. Rather, by reference to Appendix C in the case of the 1999 Agreement and Appendix D in the case of the 2002 Agreement, each instrument sets out rates of pay within the structure of a 30-point pay scale. In the absence of express provision, AMRS contended that it was proper to consider the industrial and statutory context surrounding the Agreements. This required attention to the objective facts. AMRS argued that the translation exercise undertaken within Powercor after the 1997 Agreement was not relevant to the construction question. Even if this exercise could be taken into account in construing the 1999 Agreement, at the time of certification of the 1999 Agreement (and the 2002 Agreement), Powercor did not employ any standard meter readers. AMRS submitted that, in the circumstances, it could not be said that, viewed objectively, the pay point classification scheme in the two agreements was intended to cover standard meter readers. AMRS further argued that its approach was supported by the statutory context surrounding the certification of enterprise agreements. AMRS submitted that clause 8.2.2 of the 1998 Award made it clear that the loading of 25% attached to the rates of pay prescribed in the Award and not the rates in the 1999 or 2002 Agreements. 46 In the course of this judgment, their Honours touched on the meaning of the word ""business"" in this context. As their Honours said, to be a ""successor"" (or assignee or transmittee), it is not enough that the new employer pursues the same kind of business as the old: Gribbles at 211. What was meant by the word ""business"" in this context depends on s 149(1)(d) , which ""focuses upon succession, assignment and transmission to or of a business which is identified as the business of an employer"", which ""necessarily directs attention to what it is that the former employer had which is to be described as the 'business' of that employer"": Gribbles at 211. Their Honours went on to say (at 212): The 'business' of an employer may be constituted by a number of different assets, both tangible and intangible, that are used in the particular pursuit, whether of profit (if the 'business' is a commercial enterprise) or other ends ... In the case of a commercial enterprise, identifying the employer's 'business' will usually require identification both of the particular activity that is pursued and of the tangible and intangible assets that are used in that pursuit. The 'business' of an employer will be identified as the assets that the employer uses in the pursuit of the particular activity. It is the assets used in that way that can be assigned or transmitted and it is to the assets used in that way that an employer can be a successor. The new employer may be a successor, assignee or transmittee to or of the business, or part of the business, of an employer who was a party to the relevant industrial dispute if the new employer, having the beneficial use of assets which the former employer used in the relevant pursuit, uses those assets in the same or a similar pursuit. ... Whether the new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee, will require examination of whether what the new employer has can be described as a part of the former employer's business. In s 149(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act , ""the business or part of the business"" of the former employer which in the present case is Powercor is thus to be characterised by reference to the particular activity that it pursued and the assets that it used in that pursuit. As Stellar Call Centres shows, whether a new employer ""becomes the ... transmittee ... of the whole or a part of the business concerned"", for the purposes of subs 170MB(2) depends on much the same inquiry. 47 Stellar Call Centres applied the reasoning in PP Consultants to an inquiry under ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) (which, for present purposes, is in relevantly the same terms as s 170MB(2)). In the Full Court of this Court, Stellar Call Centres challenged the decision of the judge at first instance that, pursuant to ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(1) of the Workplace Relations Act , it was bound by awards and certified agreements binding on Telstra Corporation Ltd (""Telstra""). The question was whether a part of Telstra's business that involved the taking and responding to telephone calls from Telstra's customers had been transmitted to Stellar Call Centres. The Full Court held that there was no such transmission, chiefly because the receiving of the calls from customers were ""activities in support of Telstra's businesses in the telecommunication industry"" but were ""not themselves ... the business or part of the business of Telstra"": see Stellar Call Centres at 311. The Full Court said (at 311): That business can appropriately be characterised as providing telecommunications services to its customers. In the course of conducting that business, Telstra is called upon to respond to enquiries, requests for services and complaints from its customers, including those made by telephone. However, the making of those responses is not a distinct 'part' of Telstra's business within the meaning of s 149(1) , as explained by the High Court, any more than, for example, cleaning undertaken as a necessary aspect of the conduct of a restaurant is a 'part' of the business of the restauranteur. The business of Stellar Call Centres was the provision of telephone answering services. The answering of calls was not, however, a part of Telstra's business; and, accordingly, there was no transmission of that part of Telstra's business.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.109,0.035,0.856,0.9993,6.4235500000000005

Case1180,Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014,"The majority judgment in Gribbles shows that some aspects of the transaction between Powercor and AMRS are more relevant than others to the disposal/enjoyment test. In particular, it must be asked whether the new employer has acquired any of the tangible or intangible assets of the old employer: compare Gribbles at 212. In Gribbles , the majority found that, by the relevant transaction, the new employer did not come to enjoy either the tangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's equipment) or the intangible assets of the former employer (i.e., the former employer's goodwill): see Gribbles 214. Further, citing Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 1014 , the majority also recognised that, while both former and new employers employed the same employees, ""no employee is an asset in the employer's balance sheet to be bought or sold"": Gribbles at 214. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the former employer had not disposed of any part of its business and the new employer was not, therefore, a successor to or of any part of the business of the former employer because ""[a]t no time did [the new employer] enjoy any asset of the [former employer], tangible or intangible, which [the former employer] had used in the pursuit of its business activities"": see Gribbles at 204.

There is no evidence to indicate that they had anything in them beyond the point which the tribunal recorded as being made by the appellant, namely that they recorded the existence of Ansar Islam. This provides another reason to refuse relief. The absence of such evidence means that no useful result would ensue from the grant of relief desired by the appellant, since there is no reason to think that a further hearing with translated articles would have provided any further information to which the tribunal could have had regard relevant to its exercise of its functions: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 618 [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ. 19 The second ground of appeal focused on the way in which the tribunal expressed its reasoning for rejecting the appellant's second factual account. In particular, in its findings and reasons the tribunal reviewed each of the six matters it had raised with the appellant in its letter of 8 November, determining each of them adversely to him. However, in the course of those determinations the tribunal considered the further explanations and statements made by the appellant at the second hearing. And, on a number of occasions, it modified the harsher view it had explained in its letter as the conclusion to which it was tending at that earlier time. For example, at the second hearing the appellant explained that the account he had given in his interview with the delegate of his dealing with police officers in Pakistan was not different to the account that he had given at the first hearing. The tribunal noted that it later had listened to the tape of the interview with the delegate and found that this partly confirmed the appellant's claim of his dealings with police officers. But, the tribunal came to the view that the inherent improbability of that claim meant that it was not satisfied that the appellant had in fact had the experience that he recounted. 20 Likewise, after the second hearing the tribunal modified its earlier view concerning the appellant's claims about Ansar Islam from not being satisfied that the group existed at all, as recorded in its letter of 8 November, to accepting its existence. But it was not satisfied about the appellant's account of his connection with the group. In particular, the tribunal had noted in its letter of 8 November, as I have set out above, that it found it very difficult to accept that the appellant had not fabricated his story about the group to support a refugee claim.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.051,0.897,-0.1879,2.3413500000000003
Case1185,SZLSW v Minister of Immigration [2008] FMCA 498,This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court refusing to grant constitutional writ relief to the appellant in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa: SZLSW v Minister of Immigration [2008] FMCA 498. The appellant was a Pakistani citizen who hailed from the North West Frontier Province. 2 The appellant arrived in Australia in early September 2007 and was detained at the airport because of irregularities perceived with the manner in which he entered. He made an application for a protection visa later in September 2007 and was assisted by the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in doing so. The service continued to represent him up to the time at which the delegate refused his application. He then applied to the tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision with the assistance of a solicitor migration agent. 3 The tribunal held an initial hearing on 6 November 2007 in which a number of concerns with the claims made by the appellant were discussed. At that hearing the tribunal informed the appellant that it would write to him about issues of concern it had raised with him at the hearing and would give him the option either to provide a written submission or to have another hearing at which he could respond or comment on the issues of concern. On 8 November 2007 the tribunal wrote to the appellant confirming those options. The letter outlined detailed issues under six separate headings relating to issues that concerned the tribunal arising from his evidence at the first hearing. The appellant's solicitor migration agent responded advising the tribunal that the appellant wished to attend a further hearing.

Case1190,Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v The Australian Workers Union [2004] HCA 40 (2004) 221 CLR 309,"to the first of those issues a number of considerations are relevant. In any event, in the consideration of penalty, there were undoubtedly substantial mitigating circumstances in the present case. An important one is that, at the time when the contraventions occurred, both parties had taken the view that the relevant provisions of the certified agreement known as EBA6 were to be regarded, at least potentially, as non-pertaining provisions, and therefore were to be removed from the succeeding agreement (EBA7) by agreement of the parties, in order to ensure the certification of EBA7. The concern about whether those provisions pertained to the relevant employees of Qantas arose as a result of the judgment of the High Court in Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v The Australian Workers Union [2004] HCA 40 (2004) 221 CLR 309. The fact that the applicant, a union, was the effective recipient of a benefit from the operation of those provisions apparently caused both parties to assume that they might be non-pertaining provisions. This resulted in the agreement to remove the provisions from EBA7, to ensure the certification of that agreement. In the event, in my reasons for judgment delivered on 23 December 2008, I held that the provisions were enforceable and that breaches of them had occurred. The breaches occurred in the last days of the operation of EBA6. The employees concerned had already approved by ballot in accordance with the Workplace Relations Act the terms of EBA7, from which the supposed non-pertaining provisions had been removed. Application had been made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to certify the new agreement. The hearing of that application had been adjourned at the request of the applicant, with the agreement of the respondent, because the applicant's new office-bearers had just taken office. One of the contraventions, the failure to pay Captain Woods his entitlement to salary calculated at the rate applicable to the president of the applicant under the agreement, was simply the result of neglect. The evidence, and the finding that I made, was that the normal process was to pay in arrears at the end of a future pay period but that was never done in Captain Woods' case. As for the other contraventions, they involved failure to release two pilots from their duties in accordance with the provisions of EBA6, to enable them to attend to the applicant's business. The refusal to release them from duties arose principally from a failure to understand the significance of the expression, ""operational requirements,"" in the relevant provisions and to distinguish operational requirements from inconvenience in managing the pilots' roster. As a consequence, it can truly be said that neither of the contraventions was wilful. Each was explicable and the degree of culpability of the respondent is substantially mitigated by that. As for general deterrence, the mitigating factors are such that little purpose would be served by imposing a financial penalty. It certainly is not the case that, in every situation a party can insist on a construction of a provision of an award or certified agreement, later found to be unsustainable, and avoid the imposition of a financial penalty. Nevertheless there are cases where the adoption of a construction that is fairly open permits a court to say that the imposition of a financial penalty would not be appropriate. The special feature of this case is that both parties at the relevant time had taken the position that the relevant provisions of EBA6 were not legally enforceable, because they were non-pertaining pursuant to the Electrolux judgment. In those circumstances, it seems to me, that no purpose of general deterrence would be served by the imposition of a financial penalty. For those reasons the agreement of the parties that no financial penalty is any longer appropriate falls within the proper range to which the Court should have regard in determining issues of penalties. Accordingly, I propose to impose no financial penalty in respect of any of the relevant breaches. The parties are, of course, agreed as I suggested they needed to be, that the respondent is obliged to pay Captain Woods the amount of his underpayment and interest on that amount. Those orders will be made. As I have also said, neither party seeks to visit the question of costs, so that no order for costs will be made, on the assumption that the general rule applies that a proceeding in a matter arising under the Workplace Relations Act does not attract costs. There remains the question of the declarations. I have in the past taken the view, to which I adhere that it is generally inappropriate, to make declarations that do no more than record the findings or conclusions the Court reaches on issues of fact and law in any particular case. I have recognised in the past that, particularly under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), there has grown up a practice of making declarations which express findings as to contraventions of various provisions. My own view is that that practice is unfortunate, because the declarations so made do not amount to true declarations of right, pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). A true declaration of right provides the parties with a determination of some controversy on which they can base their future relationships. In the present case, the declarations proposed would at least have the effect of expressing the conclusion that the provisions concerned were enforceable at law. Despite Electrolux , they were not non-pertaining provisions, and were therefore binding on the parties and ought to have been complied with, not only in respect of the particular pilots but in respect of all others. For those reasons I am prepared to depart from my usual antipathy towards declarations and to make orders in the terms sought. The orders I make are as follows: The Court declares that: 1. By failing to pay Captain Ian Woods his salary at the rate calculated in accordance with cl 24.2 of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004, in respect of the period from 7 to 15 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 46.2, coupled with cl 46.6.1 of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. 2. By refusing to release Captain Simon Tuma from his allocated flying duties on 8 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 45.3.1(a) of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. 3. By refusing to release Captain Ian Smith from his allocated flying duties on 11 November 2005, the respondent contravened cl 45.3.1(a) of the Qantas Airways Limited Flight Crew (Long Haul) Certified Agreement 2003-2004. The Court orders that: The respondent pay to Captain Ian Woods the sum of $1,385.83 (less any applicable tax). The respondent pay to Captain Ian Woods interest on the sum referred to in para 4 above, in the amount of $501.92. 6. Otherwise, the application be dismissed, with no order as to costs.

Case1191,AIPA &amp; Anor v Qantas Airways [2008] FMCA 1008 (2008) 176 IR 453,"were, and are, no prior findings of any relevant contravention of the certified agreement concerned. During the time that my judgment was reserved in this case, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia imposed a financial penalty on the respondent, at the suit of the applicant, in AIPA &amp; Anor v Qantas Airways [2008] FMCA 1008 (2008) 176 IR 453. In that proceeding the learned federal magistrate found that the respondent had committed three breaches of clauses of EBA7, unrelated to the clauses of EBA6 that were in issue in the present case. The federal magistrate imposed a penalty in respect of the three breaches regarded as arising out of a single course of conduct, of $5,000 whereas the maximum penalty is $33,000. In doing so, at [84], his Honour expressed the view that the breaches were not particularly severe. They concerned conduct subsequent to the conduct in issue in the present case and the judgment was delivered while judgment in the present case was reserved. The respondent has appealed from the federal magistrate's judgment and it is apparent from the notice of appeal that there is a substantial argument about the proper construction of the provisions concerned. Accordingly, the weight of the findings made by the federal magistrate, in considering parallel conduct by the respondent for present purposes, is minimal. In those circumstances and in the light of the applicant's change of position about seeking financial penalties, it is necessary for me to consider the questions of specific and general deterrence. It is apparent that there is no need for specific deterrence in the present case. There is no indication at all that the respondent has ever had an attitude of turning its back on the relevant provisions of certified agreements. There is no occasion for teaching it the lesson that it must have regard to such provisions at all times and must comply with them. Indeed, on the evidence that emerged in the course of this case, it is undoubtedly the fact that the respondent devotes a substantial amount of its resources to ensuring that it complies with certified agreements on a daily basis.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.06,0.87,0.625,5.1775

In that case the Full Court at 44 approved a statement by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 where his Honour said that: ' 18 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the Tribunal has sufficiently raised a relevant issue that the Tribunal should have dealt with.' 45 The Full Court in NABE went on to say at 44: 'This does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant. It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it.' 46 The appellants' case was based upon a claim of political persecution. Whilst the Tribunal found that a number of threats had been made by particular persons, some of whom were politicians, it found that the motivation for the persecution was a desire to protect 'their own business interests from competition'. There was evidence to support that finding. 47 In any event, the Tribunal found that the threats did not amount to serious harm within the meaning of s 91R of the Act. In view of the fact that the Tribunal rejected the appellants' claim that the senior political figure visited his home and carried out the threats and the attack on his father-in-law, such a finding was open to the Tribunal.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.091,0.066,0.843,0.7153,5.47855

Case1210,Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16,"Metcash Trading Limited v Bunn (No 5) [2009] FCA 16 I concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt that Mr Bunn's conduct in publishing the nine allegations contained in three publications particularised in the Statement of Charge was deliberate and that, in making the allegations that he did, he disobeyed the restraint imposed upon him by Order 3.5(c) of Lander J made in this matter on 9 March 2006. I adjourned further consideration of the present motion to permit the parties to put on evidence and make submissions in relation to penalty. The applicant, Metcash, has filed further affidavit material. That affidavit outlines in some detail correspondence and other communications between Metcash and Mr Bunn which it is said were intended to bring home to Mr Bunn the effect of Lander J's orders; such concerns as Metcash had about Mr Bunn's continuing to publish criticisms of it; and its encouragement for him to obtain legal advice. The affidavit further provided some evidence of Mr Bunn's assets, at least as revealed in a property search in the Australian Capital Territory and from Mr Bunn's Statement of Affairs in his bankruptcy. Mr Bunn is an undischarged bankrupt having lodged a debtor's petition on 26 April 2006. Put shortly, what Metcash now seeks in its submissions is that Mr Bunn be ordered: (1) to pay a fine in the sum of not less than $5,000; (2) to pay the applicant's costs of the contempt application on an indemnity basis; and (3) provide a written apology to the Court for publishing what are described as the Contempt Publications. Mr Bunn has filed no affidavit and has not provided any written submissions in this matter. The character that I ascribed to Mr Bunn's contempt in my earlier reasons was as follows at [47]: ... I am not satisfied that Mr Bunn consciously and deliberately breached the order. His conduct nonetheless has been censurable. While he may not have understood the true meaning of Order 3.5(c) and hence that his conduct could constitute a breach of that order: cf Microsoft Corporation, at 143; his ignorance could provide him with no ready vehicle for exculpation. He knew he was bound by Court orders and that they precluded him from publishing or republishing certain allegations. After his exchange with Lander J on 28 February he had reason to know that his understanding of the meaning and effect of Orders 3.2 and 3.5(c) was quite imperfect. If he was to continue to publish matter critical of the Metcash companies without acting in breach of the orders, it was necessary for him to have an informed understanding of what the orders prohibited. Against that background, it was hazardous for him obdurately later to reject without inquiry the assertions about the orders made by the applicants' solicitors. Mr Bunn needed, but on the material before me did not obtain, reasonable and reasoned advice. Put shortly, he had been put on inquiry in circumstances in which it quite properly can be said he assumed the risk that his conduct might be found to be in breach of the orders. His so acting may well be a matter appropriately to be taken into account in relation to any penalty imposed on him. It clearly is the case as Lander J has observed that Mr Bunn has waged a campaign against Metcash which he blames for the collapse of his own business. Even after my decision on 20 January 2009 he again published a further edition of ""T.I.G.A."". In this edition he discussed my reasons and order and the terms of Lander J's interim injunction. The publication included in part the following: Upon Metcash's application to the Federal Court, the Honourable Justice Finn, has found that Peter Bunn is in contempt of those orders, due to 3 (out of 56) TIGA publications, (07/1-2007; 10/1-2007; and 12/2-2007) for which Bunn is responsible. The fact of the matter is that those 3 publications, were either quoting other people, or discussing Metcash's reports as to profit increases, shareholdings, or discussing possible outcomes of Metcash's actions. Justice Finn has made it clear that Bunn, or any publication for which he takes responsibility for, cannot publish any matter which can be implied that Metcash actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to prejudice, damage or destroy the business of independent retailers with whom they deal, which ultimately results in the fact that even if Metcash, or its CEO, Andrew Reitzer, make public statements, or other people make public statements, that imply such (ie Metcash puts up their fees to independent retailers), Bunn is not permitted, under the interim injunction, to publish such facts. This means that Bunn is even injucted from publishing certain statements made by Mr Andrew Reitzer himself, during the ACCC hearing into grocery prices, which could be considered that Metcash actively and deliberately operate in a manner calculated to prejudice, damage or destroy the business of independent retailers with whom they deal !!, nor is Bunn permitted to republish statements made by other people regarding Metcash's conduct !! Such an interim injunction flies in the face of free speech, and certainly beggars belief as to the desperation of Metcash to hide its conduct, instead of standing in the public forum and explaining and justifying its own actions which, obviously, Andrew Reitzer and Metcash are not, or cannot, do !! Bunn has stated that he will respect the penalty that the Federal Court issues, but of course Metcash will have to deal, eventually, before the Court, with having to justify the facts of their original claims to the Federal Court so as to obtain the said interim injunction. Metcash has asked me to draw from this a picture of a cunning individual who uses the terms of the injunction itself to in effect publish what the injunction prohibits. This it is contended reveals his culpable frame of mind. For my own part, while the publication again manifests the strength of his hostility to Metcash, it does in my view do no more than, in somewhat inflammatory language, explain the terms of the order and in his view its possible reach. There is, it should be said, a very real question, as Lander J indicated to Mr Bunn over three years ago, as to whether the terms of Order 3.5(c) are probably ""too wide"". I do accept what Mr Bunn has said that he will respect the penalty imposed by the Court and he reiterated in the penalty hearing before me that he respects the Court and its orders. I do not doubt the genuineness of what he says. Further, I should say I do not regard Mr Bunn's actions as deliberately challenging the legitimacy or justice of decisions and orders made by this Court. A fair understanding of the matter would suggest they had more to do with the lamentable state of the relationship of the parties and their mutual mistrust which clearly are contributing significantly to the glacial progression of the matter towards judicial resolution. (3) The nature and circumstances of the contempt I have outlined this in detail in my earlier reasons and simply adopt what I there said. (4) The Contemnor's culpability This, as I have indicated in the paragraph quoted above, is a matter that has concerned me. I do not consider that Mr Bunn has acted contumaciously. Nonetheless, I consider his conduct censurable. In the circumstances a reasonable person would have been put on inquiry as to the proper meaning of Lander J's orders given what Lander J said to Mr Bunn on 28 February 2006, the communications made to him by Metcash's legal advisers and, at least by his own admission, what he said was the advice of his pro bono lawyers when he discontinued his motion to have Order 3.5(c) varied. It is for this reason, whatever his misapprehension about the meaning of the order, he cannot rely upon that misapprehension to exculpate himself from the imposition of a fine. (5) The deterrent effect It is now clear at last from the publication made after my earlier judgment, that Mr Bunn appears clearly to understand what the order means. It equally seems now to be apparent to him why Lander J ventured the view that Order 3.5(c) may be too wide. Be this as it may and in light of Mr Bunn's comments to me during the hearing, I do not apprehend that he will again act in breach of the order notwithstanding the strength of his animus against Metcash as again revealed in his 2009 T.I.G.A. publication. I am equally satisfied he is well aware of the severe consequences that are likely to ensue should he so act again. Conclusion I am satisfied that in all the circumstances, while a penalty by way of fine should be imposed upon Mr Bunn, it ought not be one of significant magnitude. I have determined that a fine of $2,000 ought be imposed upon him. This, I consider, is both appropriate in the circumstances and reflects my appreciation of the relative gravity of the contempt.

Case1215,Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd v Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees' Union (No 2) (1987) 15 FCR 64,"is well accepted, the power to award costs in all proceedings is discretionary. Nonetheless, as is occasionally observed, it is ""common or usual practice"" to order that the contemnor pay costs on an indemnity basis: see eg Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd v Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees' Union (No 2) (1987) 15 FCR 64 at 86-87. However, there is no general principle or rule of law in contempt cases to this effect: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 at [6] ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs (2 nd ed, 2009) at [16.65]. As was observed by Moore J in the BHP Steel case at [8] ""in a significant number of cases where indemnity costs have been awarded in contempt proceedings, there is a link between the award of indemnity costs and the penalty for contempt. Costs can be explicitly awarded in substitution for or in lieu of a monetary or other penalty"". In the present matter as I have indicated I intend to impose what I regard as being a reasonable and adequate pecuniary penalty. I take that matter into account in my consideration of an appropriate costs order. While I have indicated that Mr Bunn's conduct is serious, I do not however regard this matter as one involving significant public interests. It is very much a matter inter partes . In saying this I should acknowledge that Metcash ultimately had to resort to contempt proceedings to secure compliance with a Court order. I nonetheless do not consider the present to be an appropriate proceeding in which to make an indemnity order notwithstanding that one justification advanced for such an order is that the bringing of such proceedings should not result in a party being further prejudiced: see eg Concrete Constructions , at 86. The present is a complex litigation in which there is quite obvious antagonism between the parties. I mean no disrespect in saying that Metcash has fought the matter with considerable vigour as is reflected in the volume of material that has been placed before me. I am not satisfied that, in addition to paying a fine, Mr Bunn should properly be called upon to pay the full costs of the considerable forces arrayed, and of the material presented, against him. An appropriate order in the circumstances in my view would be that the usual order be made and that Mr Bunn pay Metcash's costs on a party and party basis and that the costs be taxable forthwith.

Case1217,Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612,"applicant says that in ""timing"" cases such as those presented by the 1992 and 1994 years, a taxpayer can object to an assessment on the basis that it is too low. Reliance is placed on Henderson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1970) 119 CLR 612 at 646 per Barwick CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed. The applicant points out that objections in relation to the 1992 and 1994 years are before the Court in relation to an issue other than those involved in this application to amend. The amendment application is filed in all proceedings on foot, including those for the 1992 and 1994 years. Section 67(2) of the Act empowers the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time to give effect to a decision on a review or appeal. If the applicant is successful in its contention that amounts should be excised from its assessable receipts in the 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1996 years, the Commissioner will in my view have power under s 67(2) to amend the assessments for 1992 and 1994 by increasing the assessable receipts for those years. The Commissioner raised a technical obstacle to the course described in [36]. This was that as matters stand at present there is simply an application for leave to add an additional ground. Until the objections are actually amended, so that the issue for the 1992 and 1994 years are in fact before the Court, the prejudice to the Commissioner cannot be avoided. In order to assuage the Commissioner's concern, Counsel for the applicant proffered an undertaking that the issue will be brought before the Court so that an order under s 67(2) can be made. I accept that undertaking.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.039,0.031,0.93,0.3687,4.28245
Case1218,Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146,"Commissioner's complaint is as to the unexplained delay between the applicant's receipt of the 1997 assessment in August 2000 and Mr Leyden's discovery in May 2007. It is true, as the Commissioner maintains, that as an organisation (ie apart from Mr Leyden's explanation), the applicant has been guilty of serious delay. However, when Mr Leyden discovered the true position, he acted promptly to alert the Commissioner to the ""new point"" and seek his consent to raise the new grounds. As has often been said, an application for leave to amend is not the occasion for punishing a party for its delay in making the application. See Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1996) 189 CLR 146 at 155. This is very complicated litigation with many difficult issues spread over several tax years. While the delay is unfortunate, it is not of an order that should prevent all live issues between the parties being resolved in the one proceeding. I will grant leave to add the grounds the subject of pars 1 to 3 of the proposed minutes of orders handed up by the applicant. If the Commissioner seeks a more formal undertaking than that noted at [37], attention should be given to its form. I will also make the orders sought in pars 4 and 5 of the draft minutes.

Case1219,Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617,"A question then arises as to whether a substantial purpose among any other purpose of carrying on the commercial activities of Australia Post satisfies s 7(4) of the FOI Act for the purposes of Part II of Schedule 2 thus rendering Australia Post exempt from the operation of the FOI Act in relation to the list for the purposes of s 7(2) of the FOI Act. In Mikasa (NSW) Pty Limited v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617, the High Court was called upon to consider the proper construction for the purposes of s 66B(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1965 1971 (Cth) of the phrase 'for the reason that' in the context of a provision of that Act in terms that 'a person (in this section called 'the supplier') engages in the practice of resale price maintenance if ... (d) the supplier withholds the supply of goods to a second person for the reason that the second person [has engaged in a particular conduct including withholding supply of goods]'. Although the context will, of course, influence the construction to be adopted in any particular given case having regard to the provisions of the Act as a whole, Barwick CJ made this observation at page 634: In my opinion, it is not correct to so emphasise the participle in the phrase ""for the reason that"" as to interpret the paragraph as requiring the withholding of the supply to be for one reason only. In my opinion, if the likelihood that the would be purchaser would sell at less than the specific price is an operative reason for withholding that supply, the supplier engages in the practice of resale price maintenance, however many other reasons the supplier may in fact have for not supplying the goods; it is enough if it is an operative reason, that is to say, a substantial reason in the totality of reasons for the withholding of supply. [emphasis added] 45 The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (as amended) ultimately adopted provisions which expressly dealt with consequences in terms of the prescriptions in the Act of conduct engaged in for a purpose and whether, in the case of multiple purposes, the prescribed purpose was a substantial purpose. The remarks of the Chief Justice are directed to the general import of the construction to be given to the phrase 'for the reason that'. In Mikasa , Walsh J also took the view that the phrase 'for the reason that' ought to be construed to mean 'a substantial and operative reason' for withholding supplies (page 646). At page 658 of Mikasa , Stephen J said this: ... common experience suggests that decisions (at least of that nature) have lying behind them a process of decision-making involving the conscious or unconscious weighing of numerous factors, each no doubt of varying weight but each distinct from the others. In such a context each substantial and proximate reason will in my view answer the description of ""the reason"" in this paragraph.

Case1220,National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13,"In National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13 ( 'National Mutual' ), Gibbs J considered the meaning of the phrase 'for the purpose of producing assessable income' in s 88(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936 1963 (Cth) in a provision which said, 'where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing assessable income and in the year of income [certain events occurred] a proportionate part of the amount of that premium ... shall be an allowable deduction'. Gibbs J at page 18 said this: The question then is whether the words ""used for the purpose of producing assessable income"" in s 88(1) and (2) on their proper construction apply to land ... only when it is solely used or chiefly used for the purpose of producing assessable income. The section itself contains no words restricting its operation in that way. If the provisions are literally construed, they apply when the land is used for the purpose of producing some assessable income even though it is used for other purposes as well. No doubt the application of the section might be excluded if the use of the land for the purpose of producing assessable income was so insubstantial as to call for the application of the principle de minimis non curat lex , but it is unnecessary to consider that situation ... [emphasis added] 47 In National Mutual , at page 22, Gibbs J said this: I conclude that the words of s 88 should be given the broad meaning which, in their ordinary and natural sense, they are capable of bearing, and should be understood as including a reference to land which has in fact been used for the purpose of producing assessable income whether or not that was the main use of the land.

It is not possible for the decision-maker to then conclude that the payment of the fee had not caused nor was likely to cause severe financial hardship o where the appellant does not have a credit card, the failure to provide a credit card statement could not lead to the conclusion that the payment of the fee had not caused nor was likely to cause severe financial hardship o the appellant did provide evidence of rent paid in that she provided her tenancy agreement which set the rent for her premises at $135 per week o in relation to whether the appellant had ""any expenses beyond regular living expenses"", the uncontested evidence is that the appellant was receiving a Special Benefit of $512 per fortnight, and that she had provided a breakdown of her expenses which left no money available for other expenses. &#8226; in relation to the reason of the decision-maker concerning the indication by the appellant that she intended to start work on 18 December 2004: o the evidence indicated that the appellant was a low-skilled worker o her letter to the Tribunal stated ""I will start working on18/12/04 with Ford Recruitment..."" o the only inference that could be drawn from that statement was that she had approached a recruitment agency and could be offered work o the possibility of obtaining low skilled work in the future cannot be a relevant consideration to determine if the payment of $1,400 in one lump sum could cause severe hardship to the appellant. &#8226; the Tribunal failed to perform its statutory function under reg 4.13(4) Migration Regulations and as a result its decision was in excess of jurisdiction because: o once an application for a fee waiver is made the decision maker has to make a decision on whether reg 4.13(4) applies o the decision maker here made no factual findings on which to base the decision o the Tribunal made no adverse finding of credit o the facts before the Tribunal were that the appellant had a bank account with $1.00, was on a Special Benefit, and was not receiving support from her partner o it was accepted by the Department that the appellant was living under proven extreme hardship and/had been abandoned by her resident spouse o there was no evidence supporting a different conclusion. &#8226; the decision was unreasonable in the sense explained in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223 at 223-234 &#8226; the power to waive the filing fee is given to the ""Registrar, or a Deputy Registrar, of the Tribunal, or another officer of the Tribunal authorised in writing by the Registrar"". There is no evidence that the Tribunal member was duly authorised. 22 In summary the first respondent submitted the following: &#8226; it is yet to be established whether or not a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia. In any event, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal officer was a view which was reasonably open. This is correct and there is no prospect of Wednesbury unreasonableness, even assuming that Wednesbury unreasonableness does provide a separate ground of review &#8226; the primary submissions of the appellant as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to take into account a relevant consideration, or taking into account an irrelevant consideration which it was bound not to take into account, is in reality an attack on the merits of the decision. There is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in making a wrong finding of fact. It is not the function of a court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion that the legislature has vested in the administrator: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39-40 &#8226; the evidence of the estranged partner's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context in which the decision-maker was making his decision. The appellant had applied for a Partner Visa based upon her de facto relationship with the estranged partner &#8226; it is permissible for the Tribunal to develop a form which sets out the matters it regards as relevant, provided the Court is satisfied that they are not clearly irrelevant &#8226; the task of the Tribunal's delegate on the application of the appellant was to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. The findings made by the Tribunal's delegate were not only reasonably open on the evidence presented to him but were findings which he was required to make. The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address. Although Mr Donohue may have been the ""authorised officer"" in relation to making the decision within the Regulations, Mr Hajaj was authorised to send the letter containing the decision. Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375). 30 Fourth, I agree with the submission of Mr Bickford that it is yet to be established whether a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia: Andary v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 211 at [28] . (I note further with respect to this point that the High Court refused leave to appeal from the decision in Andary [2003] FCAFC 211: Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA Trans 242). In any event, the finding of the Federal Magistrate that the decision of the Tribunal delegate was one open to him in the circumstances (at [25]) demonstrates that, in the view of Jarrett FM, the decision was not ""unreasonable"". Given that in my view the Tribunal has taken into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision, and has made its decision based on findings supported by probative material, I am not persuaded that his Honour was incorrect.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.042,0.048,0.911,-0.4859,1.3083500000000003
Case1229,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Finally, I note again that it is for the appellant to make her case for waiver of the prescribed fee. While it is necessary that the Tribunal's decision be based on findings supported by probative material, or inferences of fact which can reasonably be drawn from such findings of fact (cf Deane J in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 367), as correctly observed by Jarrett FM a finding of fact by the Tribunal against the weight of the evidence (as submitted by the appellant) does not constitute an error of law, let alone jurisdictional error. The material sought by the Tribunal was probative material upon which it would make decisions, and the appellant was on notice from the contents of the application form that the Tribunal placed importance upon receiving that documentary evidence. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that failure to provide relevant material as sought by the Tribunal - even if in the view of the appellant the material would not have added anything to what she had already said in the application form - contributed to a factual scenario where the Tribunal did not achieve a state of satisfaction which favoured the claim of the appellant. Irrespective whether the appellant can substantiate her contention that the facts of this case clearly indicate suggest that financial hardship would be occasioned to the appellant by payment of the fee - and indeed in my view it appears that the appellant was in fact in such financial circumstances that the payment of the fee would cause her severe financial hardship - the fact remains that review of decisions of the Tribunal is limited to questions of jurisdictional error, and not review of the merits of the decision. Second ground of appeal 32 Migration reg 4.13(4) requires a decision as to waiver of the prescribed fee by, inter alia , an ""officer of the Tribunal authorised in writing by the Registrar"". The appellant tendered material from which it was clear, and does not appear now to be in contention, that Mr AV Donohoe is such an authorised officer for the purposes of reg 4.13(4). The letter to the appellant was signed by Mr Manal Hajaj, who is not so authorised under reg 4.13(4). I note from exhibit A1, being a document entitled ""Fee Waiver Recommendation"" dated 15 December 2004, that: &#8226; Mr Hajaj was a member of the ""Fee Waiver &amp; Priority Team"" in the Tribunal &#8226; he had recommended to Mr Donohoe that the review fee for the appellant not be waived for reasons which were identical to those communicated to the appellant by letter from the Tribunal dated 28 January 2005 and &#8226; on 28 January 2005 Mr Donohoe accepted without qualification Mr Hajaj's recommendation and reasons by marking ""Accepted"" and signing the document containing Mr Hajaj's recommendation and reasons. 33 It is clear in these circumstances that a decision was made by an officer authorised within the meaning of reg 4.13(4) - namely Mr Donohoe - that the prescribed fee not be waived in favour of the appellant.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.065,0.039,0.896,0.9051,6.14185
Case1230,Braganza v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364,"In relation to the second ground of appeal, which was added at the hearing, Mr Boccabella for the appellant submitted in summary as follows: &#8226; in Braganza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 318 ; (2001) 109 FCR 364, the Full Court held that, provided an application for waiver of a prescribed fee had been made within the prescribed period, the Tribunal could hear an application for review even if the waiver of the prescribed fee was refused &#8226; the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually made by a person called Mr Donohue rather than Mr Manal Hajaj (who was identified as the Authorised Officer on the letter from the Tribunal dated 28 January 2005) &#8226; no document signed by Mr Donohue and notifying the appellant of the decision not to waive the prescribed fee was actually sent by the Tribunal to the appellant &#8226; documents indicating that Mr Donohue was the actual decision maker were not disclosed to the appellant until the day of the hearing &#8226; the Tribunal was required to send out a letter under the authority of an authorised officer and the appellant then had 14 days to decide whether she could meet the fee waiver or not (TS p 11 ll 35-49 and p 12 ll 1-19) &#8226; it is not possible to tell from the document on which the actual decision-maker, Mr Donohue, indicated his decision, the reasons for that decision.

Case1231,David Jonathon Walsh v Mike Garrett [1998] 473 FCA,"In my view these considerations are relevant to the decision of the Tribunal for the reasons explained by Jarrett FM in his Honour's decision. I have very little to add to the reasons of Jarrett FM in this regard, other than to note: &#8226; it is reasonable for the Tribunal to state in the application form to be completed by the appellant the material it requires and upon which it will base a decision (indeed failure to so indicate could itself constitute procedural unfairness: cf David Jonathon Walsh v Mike Garrett [1998] 473 FCA per Finn J). The documents specified in the application form were referable to considerations the Tribunal could relevantly take into account in making its decision, as explained by Jarrett FM &#8226; I do not accept the submission of Mr Boccabella that it does not follow that the failure to provide such bank statements can be a relevant consideration unless the decision-maker concludes that the appellant is attempting to mislead the decision-maker. As explained by Jarrett FM, the amount of money the appellant has had in her bank accounts both at and prior to the date of application for waiver is relevant to the decision whether payment of the fee would cause her financial hardship &#8226; I note the submission of the appellant that she had no credit card, and that a failure to provide a credit card statement could not lead to the conclusion that the payment of the fee would not cause her financial hardship, however at best any error of the Tribunal in relation to this issue is an error of fact which would not of itself constitute a jurisdictional error of the Tribunal in reaching its decision in these circumstances: NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.027,0.084,0.89,-0.9466,-0.2531000000000003

The documents specified in the application form were referable to considerations the Tribunal could relevantly take into account in making its decision, as explained by Jarrett FM &#8226; I do not accept the submission of Mr Boccabella that it does not follow that the failure to provide such bank statements can be a relevant consideration unless the decision-maker concludes that the appellant is attempting to mislead the decision-maker. As explained by Jarrett FM, the amount of money the appellant has had in her bank accounts both at and prior to the date of application for waiver is relevant to the decision whether payment of the fee would cause her financial hardship &#8226; I note the submission of the appellant that she had no credit card, and that a failure to provide a credit card statement could not lead to the conclusion that the payment of the fee would not cause her financial hardship, however at best any error of the Tribunal in relation to this issue is an error of fact which would not of itself constitute a jurisdictional error of the Tribunal in reaching its decision in these circumstances: NAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 76.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.027,0.084,0.89,-0.9466,-0.2531000000000003
Case1236,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"In summary the first respondent submitted the following: &#8226; it is yet to be established whether or not a decision which is unreasonable, in the sense explained in the Wednesbury case, is amenable to review for jurisdictional error in Australia. In any event, the Federal Magistrate was satisfied that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal officer was a view which was reasonably open. This is correct and there is no prospect of Wednesbury unreasonableness, even assuming that Wednesbury unreasonableness does provide a separate ground of review &#8226; the primary submissions of the appellant as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to take into account a relevant consideration, or taking into account an irrelevant consideration which it was bound not to take into account, is in reality an attack on the merits of the decision. There is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in making a wrong finding of fact. It is not the function of a court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion that the legislature has vested in the administrator: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 per Mason J at 39-40 &#8226; the evidence of the estranged partner's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context in which the decision-maker was making his decision. The appellant had applied for a Partner Visa based upon her de facto relationship with the estranged partner &#8226; it is permissible for the Tribunal to develop a form which sets out the matters it regards as relevant, provided the Court is satisfied that they are not clearly irrelevant &#8226; the task of the Tribunal's delegate on the application of the appellant was to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. The findings made by the Tribunal's delegate were not only reasonably open on the evidence presented to him but were findings which he was required to make. The appellant's submission to the contrary is without foundation &#8226; whether the decision is a ""good"" decision or not is not the point - the question is whether it is officiated as a jurisdictional error &#8226; the facts of this case are not similar to those in WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 where the Full Court held that the Tribunal had disregarded documents that it was otherwise bound to consider if it surmised that it was possible that the documents could have been fabricated &#8226; the evidence of the estranged spouse's financial contribution was clearly a relevant consideration in the context of an application for a Partner Visa based on a de-facto relationship with the estranged spouse &#8226; there is no statutory obligation to notify the appellant in any particular way, and no suggestion that the letter was not sent to the appellant's authorised recipient at the correct address. Although Mr Donohue may have been the ""authorised officer"" in relation to making the decision within the Regulations, Mr Hajaj was authorised to send the letter containing the decision. Nothing turns on the fact that the name ""Manal Hajaj"" appeared above ""authorised officer"" in letter to appellant &#8226; in relation to the form of notification of the Tribunal's decision to the appellant, Mr Bickford relied on the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 817 where the applicant was before the Tribunal. In that case, although the applicant had previously been represented by solicitors, the hearing was conducted in the presence of the applicant, her brother and an interpreter. The Tribunal attempted to contact the applicant several days after the hearing to inform her of the decision, but was advised by the solicitors that they no longer acted for the applicant, and gave the Tribunal the last known telephone number and address of the applicant. It appears that the Tribunal contacted the applicant's brother by telephone and advised him orally of the decision on 21 August 2001. The applicant claimed that she was not notified of the decision until almost four months later. Kiefel J held that the applicant's brother was not her representative, and that advice to the applicant's brother was not notification to the applicant within the meaning of s 368D of the Migration Act . The applicant was first notified of the decision four months later, when she herself received a copy of the decision of the Tribunal, and that time began to run for an appeal from that point. However her Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, and held that the form of notification did not invalidate the actual decision of the Tribunal itself, because it did not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act that such a consequence would follow (at [11]) &#8226; the significance of the decision of the Full Court in Braganza [2001] FCA 318 ; 109 FCR 364 is that in that case their Honours held that where an application for review of the Minister's decision and a request for fee waiver are made within the period prescribed by s 347(1) Migration Act , the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the application for review provided that the application to set aside the Minister's decision is valid if made within the prescribed period and the fee is eventually paid or paid within a reasonable time after the waiver application is rejected (in particular at 375).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.037,0.038,0.926,-0.2833,2.0124500000000003
Case1237,"re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50","First, in my view Mr Bickford correctly stated the process by which the Tribunal was required to reach its decision: namely to achieve, on the evidence presented by the appellant, a state of satisfaction as to whether the payment of the fee required by the regulations had caused, or was likely to cause, severe financial hardship to the appellant. This approach is consistent with the approach required of the Tribunal in reaching other decisions under the Migration Act : cf, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 and Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510. The appellant does not bear an onus to satisfy the Tribunal that the fee should be waived (cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH [2006] HCA 53 ; (2007) 231 ALR 340 at 351) however it is clear that it is for the appellant to advance whatever evidence or argument she wishes to advance in support of her claim: cf Abebe 197 CLR at 576, cf re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 at [9] .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.075,0.035,0.89,0.743,5.560499999999999
Case1238,Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 218 ALR 733,"In relation to these grounds Jarrett FM found in summary: 1. The conclusion that the Tribunal officer came to in his reasons for decision was that he was not satisfied that the onus upon the appellant had been discharged by her, which was a view that the Tribunal officer was entitled to take. Further, even if it were the case that the Tribunal officer's finding was against the weight of the evidence before him or her, and might be said to be a perverse finding of fact, it did not amount to an error of law, let alone jurisdictional error [25]-[26]. His Honour referred to comments of Kirby J in Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 218 ALR 733 at [67] in relation to this proposition. 2. In relation to alleged irrelevant considerations: a. the appellant's partner's financial circumstances was not an irrelevant consideration; b. in a decision that concerns the capacity of the appellant to pay a fee, her assertions as to her employment status, either at the time of the application or soon thereafter, were plainly relevant. 15 Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the application. 16 There are two grounds of appeal before the Court. 17 First, in her notice of appeal filed 29 August 2006 in this Court, the appellant claimed that ""the Federal Magistrate failed to find a jurisdictional error when the initial decision by the Tribunal was made with jurisdictional error"". As of 29 August 2006 the reasons for decision of Jarrett FM had not been made available, and the solicitors for the appellant indicated that particulars of the error of jurisdiction would be provided at a later date. The appellant subsequently provided the following particulars: &#8226; ""The Federal Magistrate erred in not deciding that the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable. &#8226; All the evidence before the Tribunal was that the appellant was penniless. &#8226; The Tribunal found that because the appellant had not complied with a non-regulatory policy through not producing a specific set of documents (not required by regulation) that she was therefore not going to suffer severe financial hardship as a result of paying the filing fee (of $1,400). (The list of documents in the policy does not even purport to be an exhaustive list). &#8226; In the circumstances, the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable. &#8226; In this regard, the Federal Magistrate, in paragraph 25 of the reasons, justified the decision of the Tribunal by simply stating that the Tribunal has determined that the review applicant (the appellant) had not discharged her onus of proof. &#8226; But the Tribunal did not dismiss the appellant's application for a fee waiver because she failed to discharge any onus of proof, the Tribunal went impermissibly further by stating that the absence of certain documents meant that the Tribunal could make an actual finding that the review applicant would not suffer severe financial hardship. &#8226; Further the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the absence of evidence of the estranged spouse's financial circumstances yet there was no finding either at the primary (Department) level or at the Tribunal stage that there was any financial support from the estranged spouse and no evidence that the appellant was in a position to provide evidence of the financial circumstances of the estranged spouse. &#8226; The Tribunal failed to perform its statutory function under reg 4.13(4) Migration Regulations and as a result its decision was in excess of jurisdiction."" 18 Second, at the hearing before me, Mr Boccabella for the appellant sought leave to add a further ground of appeal based on s 347(1) of the Act, which provides that an application for review of an MRT-reviewable decision must be in approved form, given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period, and be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any). This ground of appeal is that the appellant has not been given proper notice of a decision, and is entitled to a reasonable period after proper notice has been given (which has not yet occurred) to have an opportunity to pay the prescribed fee.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.048,0.059,0.894,-0.2477,2.14705

If the letter purported to be from the actual decision-maker, who was an authorised officer within the meaning of Migration reg 4.13, it should have been drafted in such terms that it be from Mr Donohue himself. However, notwithstanding this irregularity with respect to the manner in which the decision was communicated to the appellant, in my view the validity of the decision itself is not compromised. A decision that the prescribed fee not be waived was made by a person authorised to do so in the Tribunal. The Tribunal communicated that decision to the appellant. My attention has been directed to no provisions in the Migration Act which require the decision of an authorised person to be communicated to the appellant by that authorised person. I agree with the submission of Mr Bickford that an analogy may be drawn with the decision of Kiefel J in Sochorova [2002] FCA 817 to the effect that that such a consequence does not follow either expressly or impliedly from construction of the Migration Act . 38 As Mr Boccabella submitted, the facts before the Tribunal pointed to the appellant being of very limited financial means, and a person for whom payment of the prescribed fee would cause severe financial hardship. However whether payment of the fee would cause the appellant severe financial hardship was a decision for the Tribunal on the facts and material before it. In the absence of jurisdictional error, the decision cannot be disturbed by this Court. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 1. The appeal be dismissed.

That is undoubtedly correct. 32 The Committee discussed Dr Mathews' submissions on the Draft Report in the Final Report at [95] [100]. It declared at [96] that after careful consideration of the submissions, it was not persuaded to change its finding that Dr Mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services. Dr Mathews characterises his submissions as 'careful, detailed and reasoned' and the amendments which the Committee made in its Final Report as 'grudging and minor', but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language, without more, is unhelpful. It was further submitted that, in essence, Dr Mathews' contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the Committee did not accept the changes to the Draft Report which he proposed. In my view, there is substance in that submission. 33 Dr Mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged pre-judgment. These were summarised in the respondents' written outline of submissions as follows: ' (a) Appendix 1, service no. 4 At the Committee hearing on 30 October 2003 the applicant told the Committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist, ordered an IGE test, thinks he performed a spirometry test and that ""the management plan for her was Ventolin."" In the Draft Report the Committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patient's presenting problem. The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I do not accept this reason. I referred the patient to an allergy specialist; ordered an IGE pathology test and performed a spirometry test. I had also been prescribing her Ventolin. In my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan. In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (b) Appendix 2, service no. 1 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. At the Committee's request, he read out his clinical note: ""Vomiting, Promethazine, 4 u.e., urea, electrolytes and creatinine which is in those days I think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days I think."" In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history of ""vomiting"". I knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine. There was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of Promethazine and I advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function, kidney function and the state of her hydration."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (c) Appendix 2, service 3 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that he did not remember the consultation. He read out his clinical note: ""FOC, Ceclor CD, Ventolin and Becloforte. In answer to a question about whether he performed a peak-flow reading, he said: ""I did not perform a peak flow reading, it is not written down. I do not know whether I did. Sometimes yes I did but it is not written down there so I do not recall. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia that ""At this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest. No peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report: ""I did record a selective history with my shorthand notation 'FOC'. The patient's history of asthma and smoking was known to me. I did record my management plan which was to prescribe Ceclor for his chest infection; Ventolin and Becloforte for the patient's asthma. The evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the Committee cannot make such a finding (see T p 26 line 31 ff)."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in the Draft Report. (d) Appendix 3, service 15 At the Committee hearing on 31 October 2003, the applicant told the Committee that: ""I gave him the Ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner, Christine, who was an invalid. So in a fashion he was a carer, and as I said, his legs he had been my patient for probably 15 years."" The applicant also told the Committee that: ""The presenting complaint with Ron was that he was had massive anxiety because he was worried about Christine and his knees there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before, that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine, because when Christine fell over he would have to pick her up, and as I said he has I have asked him to have his knees x-rayed many, many times. He has never had it x-rayed. He is non-compliant. In its Draft Report, the Committee said inter alia: ""No evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input, limited examination and management. In Dr Mathew's oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for Ducene for the pain to damaged knees."" The applicant said in his submission on the Draft Report that: ""I do not agree with this view of the consultation. At T p 49 line 32, I said that I gave Ducene in an attempt to reduce the patient's alcohol consumption, not for pain. My oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patient's household. The patient's knees have been a matter of ongoing concern for some time."" In its Final Report, the Committee repeated the finding that it had made in its Draft Report.' (Footnotes omitted) 38 Pursuant to subs 106K(3), the Minister made Health Insurance (Professional Services Review Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No. 1) ('the Sampling Determination'), which provides, inter alia : ' Part 1 Preliminary 1 ... 2 ... 3 Purpose This Determination specifies the content and form of a sampling methodology that may be used by a Committee in making findings for an adjudicative referral. 4 Application (1) This Determination applies if the Committee decides, in respect of conduct in connection with rendering or initiating the services included in a particular class of the referred services, to have regard only to a sample of the services included in the class. (2) The sampling methodology in Part 2 applies to: (a) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of services; and (b) individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of patients. 5 Definitions In this Determination: Act means the Health Insurance Act 1973 . class size , in relation to a sample, means the number of services rendered or initiated in the particular class of referred services from which a sample is chosen. exploratory sample has the meaning given in section 8. final random sample has the meaning given in section 10. preliminary random sample has the meaning given in section 6. Note 1 The following terms that are used in this Determination are defined in subsection 3 (1) of the Act: &#8226; Initiate &#8226; Patient. ... Part 2 Sampling methodology 6 Preliminary random sample In having regard, under subsection 106K (1) of the Act, only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services, a Committee must ensure that the sample (the preliminary random sample ) is a random sample. 7 Appropriate sample size (1) The preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95% confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within +/- 10% of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled, at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50% of services rendered or initiated (the incidence requiring the largest sample). (2) For a class of services specified in a referral, the appropriate sample size of the preliminary random sample is at least: N __________ 1+0.01(N-1) where: N = class size. (3) If the appropriate sample size worked out is not a whole number, it must be rounded up to the next whole number. 8 Exploratory sample In making a finding based on statistical sampling, the Committee must: (a) examine a sample, preferably of 30 or more services (but not less than 25 services) (the exploratory sample ) , randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample; and (b) determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice. 9 Percentage of inappropriate practice in exploratory sample (1) After the Committee has determined which of the services in an exploratory sample constitute inappropriate practice, it must work out the percentage of services in the sample that constitutes inappropriate practice. (2) The percentage must be expressed as a whole number (being, if necessary, rounded down to the nearest whole number). 10 ...' 39 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue. Paragraph (d) contains the first allegation of error. Dr Mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the Sampling Determination, in particular the words 'must ensure', when used in relation to the words 'that the sample (the preliminary random sample) is a random sample', effectively requires the Committee to undertake the sampling itself. Alternatively, it is said that if s 6 does not require the Committee to do the sampling itself, it requires the Committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services, included in a particular class of selected services, is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the Committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class, derived from a larger list of services of that particular class, 'fed' to them by the Director, even if the Committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample. 40 The primary submission can be rejected out of hand. On no construction of s 6 of the Sampling Determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the Committee itself.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.044,0.037,0.919,0.9232,6.224200000000001
Case1247,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"The question which arises is whether this error invalidates the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report, namely, that the conduct of Dr Mathews in connection with rendering MBS Item 23, 24 and 193 services that were the subject of Adjudicative Referral 223 was, in the Committee's opinion, unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners and constituted inappropriate practice as defined in s 82 of the Act. In my view it does and for the following reasons: 1. The importance of complying with the sampling methodology in the Sampling Determination is borne out by all the provisions of s 106K of the Act, but in particular the deeming operation of subs 106K(2) and the fact that the Committee is, by subs 106K(4), prohibited from using a sampling methodology that is not specified in a determination made under subs 106K(3), unless it is ordered by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia that the sampling methodology is statistically valid. 2.

In determining the purpose of the legislation, regard has to be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'. 4. Nevertheless, having regard to the mandatory terms of s 8 of the Sampling Determination and its importance in the process of statistical sampling upon which the Committee's finding is ultimately made, I am of the view that it is a purpose of the Sampling Determination that a finding made in reliance on an act done in breach of s 8 of the Sampling Determination is an invalid finding: See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 per McHugh J at [72] [73]; per Hayne J at [205].",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.09,0.02,0.889,0.978,6.35
Case1248,Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656,"With respect, I also have difficulty with this ground of review. Indeed, counsel for Dr Mathews accepted that there is no 'general law' requirement that administrative decision-makers must give reasons: Public Service Board v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1985) 159 CLR 656. In that case, it was acknowledged by Gibbs CJ (at 670) and by Deane J (at 676) that there may be 'special circumstances' where natural justice requires reasons to be given, however, only one instance was cited in which 'special circumstances' have been found in the intervening period. This suggests that 'special circumstances' are particularly rare. 24 On behalf of Dr Mathews, it was submitted that the legislative context in the present case gives rise to such 'special circumstances'; the statutory provision regarding the drawing and provision of a draft report and permitting further submissions on it from an applicant would be meaningless unless the reasoning were to be exposed both as a necessary matter of statutory construction and as a matter of procedural fairness to Dr Mathews. Whether or not this is so, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the Committee did give reasons in its Draft Report see ground 4 above and it is idle to suggest that an applicant who is able to produce submissions responding to virtually every sentence in the Draft Report was not informed about the reasoning process which the Committee had adopted. I agree with this submission. 25 Ground 5 is as follows: ' [The Committee's] Draft and Final Reports, considered together, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, in that a fair-minded lay-person, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings and the matters in issue, who is aware of the evidence and submissions in the proceedings, including the further evidence provided by [Dr Mathews] after the hearing, would consider that [the Committee] was biased against [Dr Mathews] , in the sense that their mind was closed to the issues raised by [Dr Mathews] and nothing [Dr Mathews] said after the preparation of the Draft Report could have changed the view that [the Committee] had taken about [Dr Mathews'] case.' 26 The Application contains the following particulars with respect to this ground of review: '(i) Nowhere in the appendices to the Final Report, in which the purported reasons for the material findings were outlined, is there any express acknowledgment of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . (ii) But for formal acknowledgement that the submissions and evidence were received, and several minor modifications, no change to the findings or reasons for findings is made as a result of the further written evidence of [Dr Mathews] . (iii) [Dr Mathews'] oral evidence, accepted with little comment at the hearing, is barely referred to in either the body of the report or the appendices. (iv) [The Committee] failed to undertake its own random sampling in accordance with s 106K of the Act, relying instead on a pool of samples drawn by [HIC] and already examined in detail by the [Director] (in his investigation prior to the Adjudicative Referral) and already found by him (or his officers, servants and agents) to have been sufficiently deficient and/or adverse to [Dr Mathews] to cause him to refer the matter to [the Committee] . The pool was accordingly, no longer a random sample by any definition of that expression.' 27 Dr Mathews submits that the Final Report contains only the most grudging and minor amendments (styled by the Committee as 'clarification' see [98] of the Committee's Final Report), makes no acknowledgement of Dr Mathews' further evidence, and, in the main, ignores Dr Mathews' submissions entirely and is, for those reasons, affected by apprehended bias.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.042,0.051,0.907,-0.875,-0.05349999999999966

Case1251,Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97,"I agree with the submissions of counsel for the respondents that the Committee treated the deficiencies which it found in Dr Mathews' records as one only of the relevant factors which it took into account when making findings of inappropriate practice in respect of each of the three MBS item services. It did indeed treat adequate record keeping as a component of the clinical input necessary for proper treatment of the patient and that approach is consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Tisdall v Health Insurance Commission [2002] FCA 97 at [82] where Tamberlin J said: 'It is evident from the language of the Final Report that the Committee did not treat the failure to keep records, for example, in itself sufficient justification to arrive at its findings. Rather, the Committee took this into account as a relevant factor and in my opinion, it was entitled to adopt this approach and to enquire into this matter.' I agree with his Honour's approach. 79 For the foregoing reasons, this ground of appeal cannot be sustained. 80 It follows from the foregoing that the Committee's finding at [2] of its Final Report is invalid because it is predicated upon the Committee's failure to observe the sampling methodology of the Sampling Determination, in particular, the provisions of s 8. In the circumstances, the appropriate declaration and orders are that: 1. The Committee's Final Report be declared invalid. 2. Adjudicative Referral No. 223 be set aside. 3.

Case1252,Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425,"In relation to this ground, I was referred to what was said by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [28] as to the proper test to be applied for apprehended bias in the case of administrative proceedings held in private. To fully appreciate what their Honours there said, one needs to refer also to the surrounding context of [27] [31] inclusive: ' [27] The test for apprehended bias in relation to curial proceedings is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. That formulation owes much to the fact that court proceedings are held in public. There is some incongruity in formulating a test in terms of ""a fair-minded lay observer"" when, as is the case with the tribunal, proceedings are held in private. [28] Perhaps it would be better, in the case of administrative proceedings held in private, to formulate the test for apprehended bias by reference to a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias. Whether or not that be the appropriate formulation, there is, in our view, no reason to depart from the objective test of possibility, as distinct from probability, as to what will be done or what might have been done. To do otherwise, would be to risk confusion of apprehended bias with actual bias by requiring substantially the same proof. [29] Though the test in administrative proceedings, as in curial proceedings, is, in our view, one of objective possibility, the non-curial nature of the body or tribunal in question and the different character of the proceedings must, as already indicated, be taken into account. In the present case, a significant difference between curial proceedings and the proceedings of the tribunal is that the former are adversarial and the parties are usually legally represented, whereas the latter are inquisitorial in nature and the parties are not represented. [30] Where, as in the present case, credibility is in issue, the person conducting inquisitorial proceedings will necessarily have to test the evidence presented -- often vigorously. Moreover, the need to ensure that the person who will be affected by the decision is accorded procedural fairness will often require that he or she be plainly confronted with matters which bear adversely on his or her credit or which bring his or her account into question. Similar questions by a judge in curial proceedings in which the parties are legally represented may more readily give rise to an apprehension of bias than in the case of inquisitorial proceedings. [31] Where, however, parties are not legally represented in inquisitorial proceedings, care must be taken to ensure that vigorous testing of the evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses do not result in the person whose evidence is in question being overborne or intimidated. If that should happen, a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person might readily infer that there is no evidence that the witness can give which can change the decision-maker's view. 29 There is no submission on behalf of Dr Mathews in relation to this ground of apprehended bias that he was overborne or intimidated by vigorous testing of his evidence and frank exposure of its weaknesses at the hearing before the Committee such as to lead a fair-minded lay observer or a properly informed lay person to infer that there is no evidence he could give which could change the Committee's view. The only basis of this ground is put in terms of [27] supra. 30 It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Dr Mathews' contention that the Committee ought to have had regard to unspecified 'further evidence' allegedly incorporated in his submissions on the Draft Report should be rejected. It was submitted that while Dr Mathews was entitled to make '... written submissions suggesting changes to the Draft Report ...', he was not entitled to give evidence see subs 106KD(3) of the Act.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.058,0.073,0.869,-0.658,0.7120000000000002

Case1257,"Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 , 76 ALJR 966","One Ground of Appeal asserts a failure to accord procedural fairness. Reliance is placed upon Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 , 76 ALJR 966 , a decision which the Appellant maintains is "" identical "" to his own. 21 The Notice of Appeal goes on to state: ... My case is identical to Muin contending a want of procedural fairness in two respects. Muin had been misled into believing that the Tribunal had read some information, which had been in part B documents; and the Tribunal had not drawn to his attention some material adverse to his claims so as to enable him to comment upon them. It is the first of those contentions, which is relevant here. 22 In Muin the applicants had been led to believe that the Tribunal had certain documents -- called the Part B documents -- which had been before the delegate. Those documents were not before the Tribunal. A majority of the High Court concluded that there had been a denial of procedural fairness. Hayne J referred to an agreed statement of facts and concluded: [256] ... The consequence of what has been agreed between the parties to each of the present actions is that each plaintiff was led to believe, by what the Tribunal said, that it had material relevant to that plaintiff's claim which it did not. [257] The agreed facts are silent about whether the Tribunal was aware of the information and opinions contained in the PtB documents. It may have been, but more importantly, it may not. It follows, therefore, that in each case, the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness. Neither plaintiff was given an opportunity to place before the Tribunal the material and submissions which, on the agreed facts, it is accepted that he or she would have submitted if not mistaken about what was before the Tribunal. Moreover, it also follows from the parties' agreement that each plaintiff would have made further submissions and sought to adduce further evidence that the Tribunal did not comply with the statutory provisions governing its conduct of the reviews of the plaintiffs' cases. It did not give each plaintiff the opportunity to make the submissions or give the evidence which the plaintiff wished to make and give. For these reasons, Question 1 of the questions reserved should, in each case, be answered ""yes"". Gummow J (at [171]) and Kirby J (at [194]) agreed with Hayne J. Gaudron J also agreed that there had been a denial of procedural fairness. 23 One difficulty confronting the Appellant in the present proceedings is not the principle for which Muin is authority; the Appellant's difficulty is the application of Muin to the circumstances of the present appeal. 24 The material before the delegate is set forth in his decision dated 11 December 2006. The material that was before the Tribunal is also set forth in its reasons for decision. There was no identification by the Appellant of those documents which he contended should have been before the Tribunal but were not. Generalised assertions as to a denial of procedural fairness and a citation of the decision in Muin does nothing to assist this Court in the resolution of a challenge to a decision of the Tribunal: SZJMU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1344 at [16] per Mansfield J. 25 A further difficulty confronting the Appellant in his reliance upon Muin is the fact that this ground was also not raised before the Federal Magistrate for resolution. Again, it is a ground apparently inserted consequent upon the meeting with the migration agent. Again, leave to raise this as a Ground of Appeal is refused. 36 An instance of such indiscriminate repetition of grounds advanced in other proceedings into the circumstances of the present appeal is, it is considered, exposed by the Appellant's reliance upon the decision in Muin. The documents which were not before the Tribunal in that case and which occasioned the denial of procedural fairness had been there identified as "" the PtB documents "". But there were no comparable documents identified in the present appeal which were said to have been not before the Tribunal and thereby denying the now Appellant of procedural fairness.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.066,0.048,0.886,0.9126,6.1761
Case1258,"Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437","One ground, however, asserts that the Federal Magistrate failed to apply "" the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 "". 8 Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 was a decision of the Full Court which concerned whether a person was a refugee who could reasonably relocate within his own country. Black CJ, at 440 1, concluded in part as follows: The appellant's primary argument must be rejected. Although it is true that the Convention definition of refugee does not refer to parts or regions of a country, that provides no warrant for construing the definition so that it would give refugee status to those who, although having a well-founded fear of persecution in their home region, could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country. The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region, but upon a more general notion of protection by that country. If it were otherwise, the anomalous situation would exist that the international community would be under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality even though real protection could be found within those borders. Whitlam J agreed. The conclusions of the Chief Justice were further considered by the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 at [10] , [2007] HCA 40 ; 237 ALR 634 at 636 per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Their Honours there accepted that the basic test is whether it is reasonable, in the sense of being practicable, for a claimant to relocate to a region where objectively there is no appreciable risk of the occurrence of the feared persecution. 13 Leave to raise reliance upon Randhawa is refused. It is a ground which has no substance. 14 A number of grounds assert that the Tribunal failed to consider the claims being advanced. One ground thus asserts that the Tribunal's decision failed to take "" into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim ."" Another ground separately asserts that the "" Tribunal did not take in to account certain relevant consideration or 'integers' central to the applicant's claim "". Other grounds refer to the "" immense and intimidating pressure "" to which the now Appellant was exposed and assert a failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider those matters. 15 A number of answers may be given for rejecting these grounds. 34 In the present proceedings, a number of the Grounds of Appeal are in substantially the same terms as were before Justice Collier in SZINP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747. Those grounds in the present appeal provided (without alteration): 3. The learned Federal Magistrate has dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 4. The Federal Magistrate made a legal, factual and jurisdictional error in not applying the principles laid down by the full court of Federal Court in Randhawa v The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Afairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. 5. The Federal Magistrate failed to take consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and consequences of the claim. ... 11. The Tribunal applied the wrong test: Particulars: a) The Tribunal applied the wrong test, by requiring independent evidence of the fact before the Tribunal would accept a claim being made by the applicant the Tribunal was , in fact , placing high an onus of proof an the applicant and failing to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt. b) The Tribunal left out individual elements of the applicant's claims and tested whether they individually amounted to persecution rather than look at the claim as a whole to determine whether the claim so considered amount to persecution. The grounds as they were expressed in the proceedings before Collier J differed to the extent that those grounds did not refer to the Magistrate as being "" learned "" and did not refer to the decision in Randhawa as being a decision of the Full Court or the citation to that decision. There is not much other difference between these grounds in the present proceedings and those before Collier J. 37 Reliance upon Randhawa may provide a further instance. The ground now relied upon in this Court did not find its counterpart in any of the grounds relied upon before the Federal Magistrate and was not mentioned in the applicant's written submissions as filed with that Court. 38 Other parallels may also be discerned from a comparison between the grounds raised in the present proceedings and those before Collier J. 39 The orders of the Court are: 1.

Case1269,SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673,"appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 3 April 2008. She lodged an application for protection visa, which was refused by a delegate of the Minister. On an application for review of that decision, the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate. The Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant's conduct in Australia satisfied s 91R(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). On an application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court, Raphael FM dismissed the application ( SZNAL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 673). In her notice of appeal the appellant raises a single ground, which, as particularised, may raise certain sub-grounds. The ground in the notice of appeal is that the Federal Magistrate failed to consider the applicant's claim that the RRT decision was affected by jurisdictional error in that it incorrectly applied s 91R(3) of the Act. The particulars are: ""According to s 91R(3) , the Tribunal must disregard the applicant's conduct in Australia."" ('Ground 1') ""The Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to establish the purpose for her Falun Gong practice in Australia."" ('Ground 2') ""The applicant claims that she did not practise Falun Gong for the purpose of her current visa applicant."" ('Ground 3') Before the Tribunal the appellant claimed that she became a practitioner of Falun Gong in 1998 but that in 1999 she ceased practising Falun Gong when Falun Gong was banned. The appellant did not claim to have left China because she was a Falun Gong practitioner who was unable to practise Falun Gong.

There Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: ""The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights (see Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at p 12, per Mason CJ)."" They said that application of this principle by the Courts would be likely to enhance the Parliamentary process by securing a greater measure of attention to the impact of legislative proposals on fundamental rights: Coco 179 CLR at 437-438. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Sciascia (1991) 31 FCR 364 at 370-372 Burchett and Lee JJ discussed (in passages approved in Haneef 163 FCR at 443 [108] and [111]) a statutory predecessor of s 501 that provided that an illegal immigrant was liable to deportation if that person had been convicted of offences and been sentenced to imprisonment for at least one year. They said that the section deprived the persons ""caught by it of one of their most precious rights, their right of community"". Burchett and Lee JJ said that the making of a deportation order was a plain infringement of liberty and was more so if the law authorising it was retroactive. They said ( Sciascia 31 FCR at 372): ""Both retrospectivity and curtailment of liberty, when found in any statute, are strong pointers towards a construction strictly confining its operation.""",Criminal Case,Rape,0.113,0.039,0.848,0.9865,6.37875
Case1277,Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338,"long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.121,0.06,0.819,0.9153,6.14255
Case1278,Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163,"is a jurisdictional error for an administrative tribunal to ignore relevant material: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The tribunal must give its reasons for its decision pursuant to s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act . The reasons must include the tribunal's findings on material questions of fact together with a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based: s 43(2B). As McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 346 [68] , in respect of the analogous provision in s 430 of the Migration Act , the tribunal need not make findings on any and every matter of fact objectively material to its decision. They said that s 430: ""... requires no more than that the tribunal set out the findings which it did make. Neither expressly nor impliedly does this section require the tribunal to make , and then set out, some findings additional to those which it actually made."" (original emphasis) The assessment was considered by the tribunal in relation to Mr Toro Martinez's return to Columbia and the position of his fianc&eacute;e. But, the tribunal assessed his relationship with his daughter only on the basis of the 15 April 2008 letter. The tribunal did not expressly consider the assessment's conclusion that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to travel to Columbia, no doubt, because of its finding as to the nature of the relationship between her and her father. Since I have found that the tribunal ignored and thus, failed to have regard to the strongly corroborative and relevant material in the daughter's 2001 interview and 2007 letter, I am satisfied that it committed a jurisdictional error: Craig 184 CLR at 179. Ground 3 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that it was reasonable for it to conclude that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia. The tribunal noted that he had claimed that he might face personal danger in ""certain regions"" but that he had not asserted that Cordoba was one of them. It said he had no knowledge of any particular problems, of the nature he feared, in the town in which his sole surviving uncle lived. The tribunal had relied upon the conclusion of the departmental officer who had compiled the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that there was a mere possibility that Mr Toro Martinez might suffer serious harm as a result of indiscriminate generalised or random violence were he to return to Columbia. He complained that the tenor of the assessment was replete with references to instability, human rights abuses at every level of government and society in Columbia, and the insurgency of guerilla groups who also indulged in substantial and repeated violations of human rights. He claimed that country information also supported a very pessimistic assessment of the state of civil society in Columbia.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.059,0.122,0.819,-0.9929,-0.41215000000000046

He contended that this retrospectively deemed the delegate's decision always to have been valid and that, as a result, the tribunal's decision affirming that decision was unimpeachable. The Minister argued that to affirm the decision under review had the effect of leaving the delegate's decision as the only operative decision. He contended that an affirmation by the tribunal of a decision of a delegate has the effect that the original decision of the delegate continues to operate and the later decision of the tribunal does not operate in substitution: Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 73 ; (2008) 167 FCR 578 at 583 [23] per Tamberlin J, with whom Besanko J agreed at 586 [42]; see also Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587F-588B per North J.

A fortiori, when it affirms a decision or sets it aside and remits it for reconsideration, it does not exercise a power conferred by the enactment under which the primary decision-maker has made his or her decision ... Analogous reasoning in Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587 led North J to conclude that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse a visa was not itself a decision to refuse the grant of the visa.""",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.042,0.019,0.939,0.7865,5.729749999999999
Case1280,Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135,"finding is the province of the tribunal. Ordinarily, an error of fact by the tribunal will not constitute a jurisdictional error, let alone an error of law.

Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. However, he argued that the tribunal's conclusion that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia was not a finding that the tribunal could make on any fair reading of the totality of the material on which it was based. He relied on the principle that if a decision-maker made a finding that was a critical step in arriving at its ultimate conclusion, but had no evidence to support it, the finding may well constitute a jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 12 [42] per Flick J.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.059,0.089,0.851,-0.7246,0.49089999999999945

Case1283,Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2106 ; (2007) 99 ALD 514,"my opinion Direction No 21 does not have that vice. The Minister asserted that it created a rebuttable presumption about the weight to be given to primary considerations that should guide the exercise of decision-makers' discretions in a uniform manner. I agree with Emmett J who said that the terms of Direction No 21 do not contain a requirement that any decision-maker, whether the Minister, a delegate or the tribunal, reach a conclusion that particular conduct of the visa holder is abhorrent: Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2007] FCA 2106 ; (2007) 99 ALD 514 at 517 [11] . I am not satisfied that Direction No 21 exceeded the ambit of the Minister's power to give it under s 499(1). Often decision-makers will be required to take into account or to have regard to, or to give weight to, numerous, sometimes conflicting factors in arriving at decisions by force of legislation. Similarly, in general, the description of a factor as a ""primary consideration"" or the attribution of weight to be given to a factor will provide an effective guide to decision-makers but will not require them to arrive at a predetermined conclusion. Because par 2.2 requires an overall balancing process to be undertaken by the decision-maker, he or she will be able to address the necessities and circumstances of the individual case.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.027,0.047,0.926,-0.5448,1.1132000000000002

But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance.

There Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: ""The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights (see Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at p 12, per Mason CJ)."" They said that application of this principle by the Courts would be likely to enhance the Parliamentary process by securing a greater measure of attention to the impact of legislative proposals on fundamental rights: Coco 179 CLR at 437-438.

Case1288,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"am not satisfied that the tribunal committed any error in the way in which it expressed itself. Decision-makers are allowed considerable latitude in their choice of expression of the reasons they had for determining the matter as they did: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. I reject this ground. Ground 6 Mr Toro Martinez claimed that he had been denied procedural fairness because the tribunal referred to two documents in forming its conclusion that: 'Without more detailed evidence and submissions, one could not draw conclusions about the practical standard of health care that would be available to the applicant in [two named towns], but it seems safe to say that Columbia is not totally devoid of medical services."" The two documents were material from the Pan American Health Organisation as to Columbia's health system, the number of public hospitals, doctors and nurses and pages in Volume 2 of a publication ""Health in the Americas 2007"" which dealt with the State's subsidised health insurance system. It is common ground that those documents were not drawn to Mr Toro Martinez's attention before the tribunal made its decision and he had no opportunity to inspect them, or to make submissions in relation to them. Under s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , the tribunal was required to: ""... ensure that every party to a proceeding before the tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case and, in particular, to inspect any documents to which the tribunal proposes to have regard in reaching a decision in the proceeding and to make submissions in relation to those documents.""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.074,0.033,0.893,0.9106,6.146100000000001

Case1291,Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513,"Courts have developed guidelines or principles from time to time that are used in the exercise of discretions in judicial decision-making. As Mason and Deane JJ pointed out in Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 519 it does not follow that, because a discretion is expressed in legislation in general terms, the legislature intends that the Court should refrain from developing rules or guidelines affecting its exercise. They said that such rules can promote consistency in decision-making and diminish the risks of arbitrary and capricious adjudication. I am of opinion that similar considerations inform the giving and content of directions under powers such as s 499(1). It is a feature of parliamentary democracy that government policy should be carried out through the exercise of the executive power which, in turn, is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The structure of our system of government is that the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General by s 61 of the Constitution . However, in practice and as a matter of convention that power is exercised by the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth who administer departments of State pursuant to s 64 of the Constitution . And, s 64 also requires that a Minister may not hold office for longer than three months unless he or she becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the exercise of the executive power under Ch II of the Constitution is confided to Ministers who are answerable for their conduct of the executive power in the Parliament. One purpose of the Parliament enacting legislation with broad discretions, such as are found in s 501(2) of the Migration Act , is to accommodate changing government policies over the years. The constitutional scheme of responsible government would be defeated if departmental decision-makers were entirely free to arrive at their own idiosyncratic views, unfettered by the control of the Minister who, by s 64 of the Constitution , is the person who administers a department of State and answers for that administration in the Parliament. Hence, the power to give a written direction under s 499 is a valuable means of the Minister ensuring that officers of his or her department will have appropriate regard to the objectives or policies of the government of the day in the exercise of their powers and functions. I am of opinion that the power in s 501(2) to cancel a visa is capable of being made the subject of a direction made under s 499(1).",Criminal Case,Rape,0.054,0.016,0.93,0.9316,6.2226

(2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to: (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there. (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2). (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit. (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness. Ground 1 Mr Toro Martinez argued that item 7 expressly referred to two classes of decision, first, those by the Minster made under identified sections of the Act (item 7(1)(a)) and secondly, by a delegate of the Minister made under only s 501 (item 7(1)(b)). He pointed out that in the 2008 amendment there was no reference to decisions made by the tribunal. He argued that if the Minister wished now to cancel a visa that previously had not been cancelled validly, he could do so under the new s 501HA. But, the Minister wished to have the legislation construed so as to make valid a decision of the tribunal which, at the time it was given, was not a decision at all because of its jurisdictional error in affirming a decision that could not have been made under s 501 ( Plaintiff S157 211 CLR at 506 [76]). Mr Toro Martinez argued that for this result to ensue clear words of necessary intendment were required, and the Parliament had not used them. He argued that all item 7(1) did was to restore validity to the delegate's decision. But, he contended, this did not affect the legal status of the tribunal's invalid decision. He argued that regardless of whether the decision of the delegate was valid or invalid, in reviewing that decision the tribunal was exercising an independent function under s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.032,0.063,0.905,-0.9699,-0.36365000000000025

Case1299,Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56,"as a result of the subsequent decision of the Full Court of this Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56 , it is common ground that Mr Toro Martinez's visa was in a class of visa that was not then capable of cancellation under s 501(2). This was because the visa did not meet the description in s 501(2) of a visa ""... that has been granted to a person"". The Full Court held that the legislative scheme providing for the conversion of Mr Toro Martinez's permanent entry permit into a transitional (permanent) visa did not involve any grant of that visa to him. If a person was the holder of a permanent entry permit immediately before 1 September 1994 then reg (4)(1) of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 provided that ""... that entry permit continues in effect on and after 1 September 1994 as a transitional (permanent) visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia"". The source of Mr Toro Martinez's visa was his permanent entry permit which was continued in effect as a visa by force of reg 4. Accordingly, it is common ground that the decision of the delegate of the Minister made on 10 March 2008 to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa under s 501(2) was invalid since the Minister had no power to cancel a visa that had not, in fact, been granted. The consequence of the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 was that the only correct and preferable decision which the tribunal could have made at the time it acted was to set aside the decision under review, because there was no power to make it in the first place. Mr Toro Martinez applied promptly to this Court to review the decision of the tribunal. Before any hearing of the application to the Court, the Minister accepted that the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied equally to Mr Toro Martinez, because the original decision to cancel his visa had no force or effect. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship wrote to Mr Toro Martinez and informed him of this outcome. The letter warned him that the legislative position may change. He was released from immigration detention. Consequently, on 26 August 2008 Mr Toro Martinez filed a notice of discontinuance of his application in the Court. Next, the Parliament enacted the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2008 which inserted s 501HA into the Act. The purpose of that provision was to reverse Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 as it applied to decisions taken after the day on which the amendment commenced, being 19 September 2008 (see Schedule 4, items 5 and 6(iii)). In item 7 of Schedule 4 of the 2008 amendment the Parliament provided that any decision to cancel a transitional permanent visa made or purporting to have been made by the Minister or a delegate before 19 September 2008 was deemed to be valid. Mr Toro Martinez was then returned to immigration detention and filed a fresh application challenging the tribunal's decision. On 5 December 2008 Emmett J dismissed that application as incompetent ( Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 1995) but his Honour granted leave to Mr Toro Martinez to withdraw his notice of discontinuance in these proceedings since the Minister did not oppose this course. His Honour also made directions in these proceedings: Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1994. What the 2008 amendment meant in the context of a person in Mr Toro Martinez's position is the principal ground of the present amended application. It is necessary to set out the relevant items of the Schedule in the 2008 amendment in order to understand the argument: "" 5 After section 501H Insert: 501HA Application of sections 501 to 501H to transitional (permanent) visas and transitional (temporary) visas If, under the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations, a person: (a) held a permanent return visa, permanent entry permit or permanent visa that continues in effect as a transitional (permanent) visa; or (b) held a temporary entry permit or temporary visa that continues in effect as a transitional (temporary) visa; or (c) is taken to hold a transitional (permanent) visa; the person is also taken, for the purposes of sections 501 to 501H, to have been granted a visa. 6 Application (1) The amendment made by item 2 of this Schedule applies in respect of a person who has been granted: (a) a bridging visa (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ); or (b) a criminal justice visa (within the meaning of that Act); on or after the day on which that item commences. (2) The amendment made by item 4 of this Schedule applies in relation to an authorised recipient, whether the notice under subsection 494D(1) of the Migration Act 1958 in relation to the authorised recipient is given before, on or after the day on which that item commences. (3) The amendment made by item 5 of this Schedule applies in respect of a decision to cancel a visa that is made under the Migration Act 1958 on or after the day on which that item commences. Validation of pre-commencement decisions in relation to transitional (permanent) visas and transitional (temporary) visas (1) To avoid doubt, any decision made or purported to have been made: (a) by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B, 501C or 501F of the Migration Act 1958 (as in force at any time on or after 1 September 1994 and before the day on which this item commences) before the day on which item 5 of this Schedule commences; or (b) by a delegate of the Minister under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (as in force at any time on or after 1 September 1994 and before the day on which this item commences) before the day on which item 5 of this Schedule commences; to cancel a transitional (permanent) visa or a transitional (temporary) visa is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permanent) visa or transitional (temporary) visa were a visa that had been granted. (2) In subitem (1): transitional (permanent) visa means a transitional (permanent) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations. transitional (temporary) visa means a transitional (temporary) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations."" GROUNDS OF REVIEW Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases: (1) The only correct or preferable decision at which it could have arrived was that the decision should be set aside because the visa had not been granted or taken to be granted for the purposes of s 501 having regard to the law later laid down in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. (2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to: (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there. (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2). (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit. (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness. Ground 1 Do the words in item 7 ""... is taken always to have been as valid"" have a retrospective operation so as to deny that the tribunal made any jurisdictional error? Mr Toro Martinez filed his notice of discontinuance in this Court on 26 August 2008, more than three weeks before item 7 came into operation as a law of the Commonwealth. Thus, it could not be said that the enactment of item 7 affected these proceedings at the time as pending or current litigation. The evident intention of the 2008 amendment was to validate earlier decisions to cancel visas that had not been ""granted"" but were nonetheless operative. Those visas were in the category that the judgment in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 had revealed could not fall within the then statutory powers of cancellation. Item 7 in the 2008 amendment is capable of operating in a manner that infringes the liberty of persons whose visas had been purportedly cancelled under decisions of the Minister or a delegate that were invalid for reasons given in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. The item is intended to restore the legal force of those decisions. The Minister argued that because item 7 has the effect of validating the delegate's decision retrospectively, the necessary consequence is that the tribunal's decision is also validated. That followed, he contended, because the tribunal's affirmation of the delegate's decision never operated (unlike the case prior to the 2008 amendment) on a valid decision of the delegate to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa even though it was not a visa that had been granted. In effect, the Minister argued that the words in item 7 ""... is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been"" not only validated the delegate's decision that had previously been invalid, but changed the status in law of the tribunal's decision. Here, the decision of the tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error at the time it was made on 19 June 2008. In my opinion the decision of the tribunal was no decision at all. The Tribunal had not made a decision in accordance with s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , because the only correct and preferable decision to which it could have arrived on 19 June 2008 was to set aside the decision to cancel the visa as not having been a decision made in accordance with s 501. The visa had never been grated to Mr Toro Martinez and was therefore outside the reach of s 501(2): Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. The 2008 amendment did not deal in item 7 with a purported decision of the tribunal. The language of item 7 addressed two of the three possible categories of decision to which Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied, namely a decision by, first, the minister under identified sections of the Act and, secondly, the delegate under s 501 alone. That raises the question whether the words ""... is as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permenant) visa ... were a visa that had been granted"" operate to change the nature of the tribunal's decision because they transformed the earlier invalid decision of the delegate into a valid decision. Although there is no evidence as to the number of potentially affected decisions, it is safe to infer that a considerable number of visas in the affected category had been cancelled over the previous years. Challenges to the cancellation of those visas, like Mr Toro Martinez's, would have been made to, first, the tribunal and then to this Court and the High Court. The consequence of giving item 7 a narrow construction is that persons who left Australia either voluntarily or involuntarily, based on failed challenges to the purported cancellation of their visas could now assert rights of re-entry and residence on the ground that the tribunal's decisions to affirm the cancellations were affected by the above jurisdictional error. It is unlikely that the Parliament intended that consequence. That may be why it chose the opening words of the chapeau to item 7(1): ""To avoid doubt, any decision made or purported to have been made."" The doubt referred to was, clearly enough, whether those two classes of decision were valid. The language of the Parliament does not suggest that it sought to create a distinction between those who had accepted a decision by the Minister or a delegate to cancel their visas without challenge and those who had applied unsuccessfully to the tribunal or the Courts to set aside the decision to cancel. Such a distinction would create, not avoid, doubt. The anomalous result would ensure that a person who had taken proceedings to reverse the cancellation but failed would be in a better position than someone who had accepted the decision in the first place. It would certainly give a new and unattractive twist to the aphorism that ""it is better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all"". If the tribunal had arrived at the conclusion, subsequently established by the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , that it had no power to cancel the visa under s 501, it would have set aside the decision of the delegate (see: s 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ). Had the tribunal done that, item 7 would not have had any effect on the tribunal's decision because the delegate's decision would no longer be operative. As Hayne and Heydon JJ identified in Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 235 CLR 286 at 314 315 [96]-[98], the tribunal's task here was to decide on the material before it whether to exercise the Minister's power under s 501(2) (if it existed). That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law. By applying to the tribunal before the 2008 amendment came into force, a person who then invoked a challenge to the Minister's or delegate's decision under s 501(2) elected to treat that decision as valid, though erroneous, and to have the tribunal exercise the power, in preference to challenging the decision in judicial review proceedings: Twist 136 CLR at 116 per Mason J. And the tribunal could have ""cured"" the defect in the delegate's decision by setting it aside: cf Zubair 139 FCR at 354. But the decision of the tribunal in respect of Mr Toro Martinez was given in respect of a different legal and factual scenario from that considered by the delegate and, because of Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , was no decision at all, being infected by jurisdictional error.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.061,0.075,0.865,-0.9897,-0.4469500000000006

Case1302,Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359,"Minister also sought to draw an analogy with stamp duty legislation that prohibited the admission into evidence of an unstamped instrument but gave the instrument, once duly stamped, its full force and effect, relying on Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359 at 383 per Dixon J. I reject this argument. First, stamp duty legislation, ordinarily, does not affect liberty of individuals or fundamental human rights. Secondly, that legislation suspends, conditionally, the operation of an existing instrument only when it is sought to be put into evidence. I do not consider that generalised references to stamp duty legislation assist in construing item 7. The Parliament enacted the 2008 amendments knowing that both the tribunal and the Courts would have made decisions affecting visas purportedly cancelled by one of the two classes of decision for which item 7 provided. Yet, the 2008 amendments did not address curing any error made by the tribunal in arriving at its decision. Nor did the 2008 amendments validate any decision of the tribunal. The liberty of an individual is at stake. The Parliament did not express, in unambiguous and clear language, its intention to remove the accrued right of persons in the position of Mr Toro Martinez to treat the decision of the tribunal as no decision at all. I am of opinion that the tribunal's decision should be quashed and a writ of mandamus issued to command it to perform its function of review according to law. Ground 2 The essence of the second ground is that the tribunal failed to have regard to or consider the evidence of Mr Toro Martinez's daughter and a departmental assessment relating to conditions in Columbia concerning the effect on her, were the visa to be cancelled. The tribunal did not make any reference in its reasons to an interview given by the daughter to the Department in June 2001 or to her letter of July 2007. The only evidence of the daughter to which the tribunal referred was her letter of 15 April 2008. The tribunal used the latter letter and her failure to refer to significant matters in it (which the daughter however had said in the 2001 interview and 2007 letter) in arriving at two important findings. Nor did the tribunal refer in its decision to the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to depart the relative safety of Australian society and accompany her father to Columbia.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.052,0.068,0.879,-0.8491,0.04115000000000002

Even though the delegate's original decision to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa was left intact, the tribunal decided that this was the correct and preferable decision on the material before it. That is, the function which the tribunal performed was a review on the merits of the delegate's decision using all of the material available up to the time that the tribunal made its decision: Shi 235 CLR at 298-299 [34]-[38] per Kirby J, 314-316 [96]-[101] per Hayne and Heydon JJ, 324-325 [134], 326 [137], 327-328 [140]-[144] per Kiefel J, with whom Crennan J agreed on this issue at 319 [117].

Case1309,Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758,"Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, Mason J explained that in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it was generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters that are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance. Mason J cautioned that the preferred ground on which that judicial power was to be exercised was that the decision was ""manifestly unreasonable"". I discussed the principles applicable to a statutory duty of, or requirement for, a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to factors in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . When the expression ""regard must be had to"" or like expressions are used in a statute in respect of a particular criterion or factor to be considered by a decision-maker, he or she is bound to treat such a factor as a central or fundamental element in the making of the relevant decision: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2009] FCAFC 23 at [267] per Jacobson, Lander and Foster JJ applying Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . Often the three primary considerations in Direction No 21 will tend in different directions. The best interests of a visa holder's child may often be to remain with his or her parent, while the protection of the Australian community or its expectations may tend in the other direction. As I said in Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [110] , in the context of ordinary principles of administrative decision-making, where fundamental weight must be given to a particular factor or factors, the requirement is that the decision-maker treat consideration of the factors, as opposed to the factors themselves, is a central element in the deliberative process. It will be in this manner that he or she will give appropriate weight to those factors. I am of opinion that par 2.17 permits the decision-maker to accommodate such an interpretation. It refers to other 11 factors that, where relevant, it may be appropriate for the decision-maker to take into account, but as par 2.17 continued, it was the government's view that: ""... generally they be given less individual weight than that given to the primary considerations."" In my opinion the requirements of Direction No 21 do not dictate any particular outcome. Rather, they reflect factors which must be considered by a decision-maker together with others which may be considered. Merely because two of the factors require that the protection of the Australian community and its expectations are to be given weight as primary considerations, does not mean that they necessarily and in every case will outweigh one or more other considerations, even if they are not primary considerations. However, by identifying some primary considerations and requiring the decision-maker to give weight to them, the direction emphasises that the decision-maker must have regard to those matters as a fundamental part of his or her deliberation. That does not preclude the decision-maker determining that some other factor is more important in particular circumstances. Ground 5 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in applying Direction No 21 in the manner in which it did. He contended that this was because at the conclusion of its reasoning it stated that par 2.17 stipulated that other considerations were to receive less individual weight than the primary ones and that notwithstanding the well prepared and well argued case for Mr Toro Martinez, after considering all the evidence, the tribunal said: ""I must conclude that the primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case."" Earlier in its reasoning it had noted that par 2.6(a) of the direction gave ""special and unique prominence and emphasis to offences involving the ... importation ... of illicit drugs"". Mr Toro Martinez had been convicted of two offences committed in November 1996. He had pleaded guilty to the first, under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of being knowingly concerned in the importation of 655 grams of pure cocaine, which exceeded the trafficable quantity. The maximum penalty for that offence was 25 years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000. Following a Crown appeal, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a three year non-parole period. He was also convicted in February 2002 of a second offence after a jury trial in respect of being the principal behind an importation of 4.492 kilograms of cocaine into Australia in December 1996. He was sentenced to 12 years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period that expired on 8 June 2008. In that context, the tribunal was entitled to have regard to the very serious conduct involved in Mr Toro Martinez's offending. The tribunal gave detailed consideration to Mr Toro Martinez's present situation. It concluded that although the evidence of his rehabilitation suggested that the risk of recidivism might be low, it was nevertheless real and, if it occurred, could have serious consequences for the community. The tribunal had regard to these factors and the expectations of the Australian community. It concluded that the seriousness of the offences and their planned and calculated nature would ultimately lead most community members to the conclusion that the appropriate course was to cancel the visa. The tribunal then turned to considering other matters in accordance with par 2.17 of Direction No 21. It found that, as I have discussed above, the daughter would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal. It also found that there was a genuine relationship between Mr Toro Martinez and his fianc&eacute;e and that she would suffer hardship both emotionally and in terms of her business, were he to have his visa cancelled. The tribunal was evidently sympathetic towards the fianc&eacute;e. It found her to be an honest and deserving woman, making the observation that ""any decision-maker would wish to avoid occasioning her any hardship, but she knew the facts and must have realised there were risks involved in continuing with the relationship"".",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.081,0.848,-0.874,-0.051000000000000156

Case1311,Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106,"long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J. That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law.

Case1320,Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337,"The principles relevant to disqualification by reason of apprehended bias are set out in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344-345: Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge ..., a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done, a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial. It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle. The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror) might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors actually influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror. The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits.

Case1335,Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344,"Several principles must be considered by the Court in determining an application for leave to extend time in which to institute proceedings. In Phillips McInnis FM referred to Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 in which Wilcox J (at 348-9) set out the principles to be adopted in relation to an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'). McInnis FM determined that those principles were applicable to the exercise of discretion under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. Accordingly his Honour (at [10]) set out the following principles: '1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The ""prescribed period"" of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a pre-condition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential pre-condition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised. (See Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287) 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. (See Doyle at p 287) 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. (See Lucic at p 416) 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. (See Lucic at p 417) 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of the court's discretion ( Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528).' 12 The above principles are drawn almost verbatim from those formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments. I consider that they are relevant to an application under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. The principles relevant to this appeal are numbers 4 and 6. 13 The appellant contends that Driver FM erred in his interpretation of prejudice for the purposes of an application to extend time in which to bring proceedings. The appellant also contends that Driver FM erred in assessing the merits of the appellant's case, because his Honour misconceived the basis of the vicarious liability of the respondent.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.093,0.064,0.843,0.9417,6.26695

Case1337,Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669,"In refusing the leave application Driver FM considered the principles in Phillips v Aust Girls' Choir &amp; Anor [2001] FMCA 109 (' Phillips '), which were approved by this Court in Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669. There is no dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of those principles; rather the dispute relates to the application by Driver FM of those principles. The paragraphs of his Honour's reasons which relate to the issues in the current appeal are as follows: 'The issues arising in the matter date from around 1998, although they extended through to 2004. Mr Gurran, for the respondent, put to me that the allegations made to HREOC came as a surprise to the respondent and the respondent rather thought that the issues might have been resolved at the termination of the complaint. A fourth relevant consideration is any prejudice in defending the proceedings occasioned by the delay. This is a material factor against the grant of an extension, see Doyle at page 287. I regard the issue of prejudice in this case as a significant factor. The complaint to HREOC was against the employer only even though it was a complaint of sexual harassment by reason of the applicant's sexual preference. No complaint having been made against the alleged harassers, no proceeding can now be brought in this court against those persons. The jurisdiction of the court is limited to considering the claim against the harasser's employer and would be based on asserted vicarious liability. For its part, the respondent asserted before HREOC that the allegations of harassment came as a surprise. ... The events complained of go back up to seven years. The respondent asserts that the individuals allegedly responsible for the harassment are no longer employed by the respondent and one relevant witness is no longer in Australia. There would be real difficulty facing the respondent in dealing with the allegations in this Court. ... The sixth consideration is that the merits of the substantive application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. The material put before HREOC and before the court to this point is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment against the persons allegedly responsible for that harassment. That is not the same thing as establishing a prima facie case against the single respondent, the employer, which would depend upon proof of vicarious liability. At this stage and particularly if the only evidence available is that of the applicant I would have to say that the prospects of success of the application against the respondent are uncertain. ... ... He [the applicant] could have brought that complaint forward rather earlier than he did. He certainly could and in my view should have pursued his rights in this court more promptly than he did. Having regard to the length of the delay in this matter which in my view is significant, the explanation for the delay which in my view is only partially convincing, the prejudice to the respondent if the proceeding continues, which in my view is real and substantial, and the interests of the administration of justice, I have come to the view that the application for an extension of time should be refused and I will so order.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.082,0.12,0.799,-0.977,-0.3784999999999994

Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22: 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several. The plaintiff might sue any one of the tortfeasors separately for the full amount of the loss, or all of them jointly in the same action.' Similar observations can be found in the judgment of Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 4.

Case1340,The Koursk [1924] P 140,"This legislative scheme is consistent with common law principles of vicarious liability of employers for tortious conduct of employees. In The Koursk [1924] P 140 Scrutton LJ said at 155: 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by ""joint tortfeasors""? and one way of answering it is: ""Is the cause of action against them the same?"" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be ""joint tortfeasors"": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasors; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with, another.'",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.113,0.012,0.875,0.8948,6.0308
Case1341,Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd and Ors [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 141 ALR 1,"This decision, which was applied in Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd and Ors [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 141 ALR 1, makes it clear that at common law, a vicariously liable employer is a joint tortfeasor with the employee against whom the tortious conduct is specifically alleged. Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22: 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several. The plaintiff might sue any one of the tortfeasors separately for the full amount of the loss, or all of them jointly in the same action.' Similar observations can be found in the judgment of Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 4.

Case1342,Wedesweiller and Ors v Cole and Ors (1983) 47 ALR 528,"Several principles must be considered by the Court in determining an application for leave to extend time in which to institute proceedings. In Phillips McInnis FM referred to Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 in which Wilcox J (at 348-9) set out the principles to be adopted in relation to an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'). McInnis FM determined that those principles were applicable to the exercise of discretion under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. Accordingly his Honour (at [10]) set out the following principles: '1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The ""prescribed period"" of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a pre-condition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential pre-condition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised. (See Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287) 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. (See Doyle at p 287) 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. (See Lucic at p 416) 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. (See Lucic at p 417) 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of the court's discretion ( Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528).' 17 There are numerous authorities of this Court in which prejudice has been considered in this context, each of which has related to prejudice which accrued during the period for which an extension is sought: see for example Wedesweiller and Ors v Cole and Ors (1983) 47 ALR 528; Hickey and Ors v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1983) 47 ALR 517; Duff and Ors v Freijah and Ors (1982) 62 FLR 280. I have not been referred to any authority in which a court has taken into account prejudice caused by delay occurring prior to the commencement of the prescribed period.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.079,0.08,0.841,-0.6496,0.7273999999999994
Case1343,Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450,"Traxon Industries Pty Ltd (Traxon) applied to the Court by motion dated 18 April 2006 for leave to serve proceedings on Emerson Electric Co (Emerson) in the United States of America (USA). The proceedings arose out of a dispute between Traxon and Emerson connected with the performance of a Confidentiality Agreement and a Distributorship Agreement relating to the marketing and sale, in the USA, of oil level control devices manufactured by Traxon. Traxon's causes of action against Emerson were for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of contract, breach of duty of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. For reasons published on 26 April 2006 the motion was adjourned and Traxon given leave to amend its statement of claim and to file further affidavit evidence in support of its application Traxon Industries Pty Ltd v Emerson Electric Co [2006] FCA 450. The principal reason for the decision not to accede to Traxon's motion was its inclusion in the application and statement of claim of the causes of action arising out of breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. These causes of action were based entirely on conduct allegedly committed by Emerson in the United States. They did not otherwise fall within any of the categories of causes of action to which the relevant rule of Court, O 8, authorising service out of the jurisdiction, applies. 2 Traxon has now filed a proposed amended application and proposed amended statement of claim together with a proposed further amended application and further amended statement of claim. It has also filed additional affidavit material. In its proposed amended application and amended statement of claim Traxon seeks to join Traxon International Ltd (Traxon International) as a second applicant. It abandons the claim for breach of duty of confidence but maintains the claim based on breach of fiduciary duty. As an alternative position, it relies upon a further amended application and further amended statement of claim which would also omit the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. 3 For the reasons which I now publish, I am prepared to grant leave to serve an application and statement of claim on Emerson in the United States in the form set out in the further amended application and further amended statement of claim. So that Emerson may also be served with a reasonably self contained set of reasons for that decision these reasons repeat elements of those published on 26 April 2006 adapted to take account of the amendments to the pleadings and the additional evidence which has been filed. 4 Traxon, on 18 April 2006, commenced proceedings in this Court against Emerson. It claimed damages for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act , at common law for breach of contract and, alternatively, in equity for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. Traxon is an Australian company which carries on the business of manufacturing, marketing and selling oil level control devices, one of which is known as the TraxOil Management System (the TraxOil Device). Emerson is incorporated in Missouri and currently trades under the business name Emerson Climate Technologies. It used to trade as Alco Controls. 5 By a notice of motion filed on 18 April 2006, Traxon sought leave to serve its application, statement of claim and supporting affidavits on Emerson in the USA. Its motion was filed pursuant to O 8 of the Federal Court Rules .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.059,0.029,0.912,0.9559,6.31565
Case1344,Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821,"The cause of action in breach of fiduciary duty is based on conduct engaged in in the United States. Even though the duty pleaded depends upon conduct in Australia that does not mean that its breach by acts outside Australia give rise to a cause of action 'arising in the Commonwealth' under O 8 r 1(a). As von Doussa J observed in Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821 , the authorities establish that 'cause of action' within the meaning of O 8 r 1(a) does not refer to all the elements of the cause of action. It refers rather to the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff his cause for complaint. In Distillers Co (Biochemicals) v Thompson [1971] AC 458 at 467, Lord Pearson said (at 468): It is not the right approach to say that, because there was no complete tort until the damage occurred, therefore the cause of action arose wherever the damage happened to occur. The right approach is, when the tort is complete, to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask the question, where in substance did this cause of action arise? Theory no (iii) is that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant, which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint has occurred within the jurisdiction. That is the rule laid down in Jackson v Spittal (1870) LR 5CP 542, which is an authoritative case, and the rule is inherently reasonable, as the defendant is called upon to answer for his wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong.' Counsel for the applicants contends that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty falls within O 8 r 1(ab)(ii). That is to say the proceeding, in so far as it seeks relief for breach of fiduciary duty is one which 'otherwise affects a contract'. In my respectful opinion that contention is unsustainable. While it may rightly be said that the fiduciary obligation, as pleaded, arises out of the asserted contractual relationship, the proceeding based upon breach of fiduciary duty does not of itself affect the contract. In my opinion, therefore, the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is not one to which O 8 r 1 applies. 77 As I concluded in the reasons published on 26 April 2006, the fact that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O 8 r 1, would be insufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule 'applies to the proceeding' within the meaning of O 8 r 2(2)(b) for so long as the claim for breach of fiduciary duty is included. As von Doussa J said in Delco Australia [at 35]: 'In this Court r 1(n) makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs. In my opinion r 1(n) makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r 1. An originating process that includes a claim that does not fall within one or more of the heads is not an originating process that meets the description of r 1, in that it is not one ""in"" any of the cases described in the rule. It is not a ""proceeding to which rule 1 applies"" so as to meet the requirement of r 2(2)(c)(b). A similar conclusion was expressed by Wilcox J in Tycoon Holdings Ltd v Tencor Jetco Inc (1992) 34 FCR 31 at 35.' 78 In the circumstances, because of the inclusion of the claim for breach of fiduciary duty, it is not possible to conclude that 'the proceeding' reflected in the amended application and the amended statement of claim is one to which O 8 r 1 applies. However the minute of further amended statement of claim which is proposed would omit the claim for breach of fiduciary duty and, on that basis, would transform the action into a proceeding to which O 8 r 1 applies. I am therefore prepared to make an order for service on Emerson in the United States of America of an application and statement of claim in terms of the further amended application and further amended statement of claim filed on 24 May 2006. A minute of proposed orders has been filed also to take account of that contingency. I will make orders in terms of the minute.

Case1346,Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 161 CLR 399,"In this case, it is not possible for the Court to make orders concerning a hypothetical question which was not the subject of a claim by the applicant, nor decision by the first respondent, nor contention before the Tribunal, nor decision by the Tribunal that is, whether the losses of the applicant could in fact be carried forward on capital account. It is not the role of the Federal Court to answer hypothetical questions or give advisory opinions: Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 161 CLR 399 at 413-415. 74 Accordingly, in view of my findings concerning question a, it is both unnecessary for me to make any findings with respect to questions e and f, and inappropriate to make the orders sought by the applicant which could follow from any consideration of those questions. 75 In the grounds of appeal the applicant submits that no reasonable Tribunal, properly apprised of its role, could have made the findings that were made. It follows from my findings in this judgment that this claim cannot be substantiated. 76 Accordingly the answer to question g raised on appeal is ""Yes"". 77 In the grounds of appeal the applicant submits that: &#8226; the Tribunal's apparent error of fact that the controller of the applicant had been prosecuted for claiming the deductions leads a reasonable observer to the conclusion that the Tribunal did not give due consideration to the material before it, and may have been biased against the applicant; and &#8226; a Tribunal acting under such a misapprehension could more readily make adverse findings of fact against the applicant.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.028,0.054,0.918,-0.7402,0.43530000000000024

Case1348,Blackwood Hodge (Aust) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1349,California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.036,0.894,0.9993,6.46155

Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997).

Case1351,Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342).

Case1353,Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.072,0.038,0.89,0.9984,6.4604
Case1354,Commissioner of Taxation v The Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199,"Although s 26(a) ITAA 1936 specifically deemed, as income, profit arising from the sale by the taxpayer of any property acquired for the purpose of profit-making by sale, or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme, it is clear that the acquisition of a property for profit-making by sale of that property can, of itself, give rise to assessable income within the ordinary usage of the word ( Commissioner of Taxation v The Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199; and note the useful discussion of the history of this principle by Davies J in McCurry v Commissioner of Taxation , unreported Federal Court of Australia, 15 May 1998). 23 The characterisation of activity as either capital or income was subject to some review by the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199, where the Court in a unanimous judgment held that it was perfectly possible for an isolated business operation or commercial transaction, entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of the carrying on of the taxpayer's business, to nonetheless constitute income in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the word, provided that the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the intention or purpose of making a relevant profit or gain from the transaction (at 209-210, 211, 220). 24 Although the Court considered the well-known proposition that mere realisation of a capital asset does not produce a gain which is assessable income, as the Court said at 213: The proposition ... requires some elaboration. First, the emphasis is on the adjective ""mere""... Secondly, profits made on a realization or change of investments may constitute income if the investments were initially acquired as part of a business with the intention or purpose that they be realized subsequently in order to capture the profit arising from their expected increase in value... It is one thing if the decision to sell an asset is taken after its acquisition, there having been no intention or purpose at the time of acquisition of acquiring for the purpose of profit-making by sale. Then, if the asset be not a revenue asset on other grounds, the profit made is capital because it proceeds from a mere realization. But it is quite another thing if the decision to sell is taken by way of implementation of an intention or purpose, existing at the time of acquisition, of profit-making by sale, at least in the context of carrying on a business or carrying out a business operation or commercial transaction. 25 Their Honours said later in the judgment: The periodicity, regularity and recurrence of a receipt has been considered to be a hallmark of its character as income in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind... For present purposes it is sufficient for us to say...that, valuable though these considerations may be in categorizing receipts as income or capital in conventional situations, their significance is diminished when the receipt in question is generated in the course of carrying on a business, especially if it should transpire that the receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme. (at 215) 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.073,0.024,0.903,0.9989,6.447150000000001
Case1355,Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd [2006] FCA 1414,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1356,Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 22 However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997).

Case1357,Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case.

However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 35 I also note comments of the Full Court in Cooling 22 FCR 42 and Selleck [1997] 799 FCA, referred to earlier in this judgment, that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.075,0.034,0.891,0.9992,6.4562
Case1359,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041,"Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.105,0.011,0.884,0.9531,6.2418499999999995
Case1360,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1361,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 22 However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369. Examples of the application of this principle can be seen in Williams 127 CLR per Barwick CJ at 240-241, Menzies J at 245, Gibbs J at 249-251, Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR 95 and Casimaty v Commissioner of Taxation 1388 FCA (10 December 1997). Relevance of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 30 In identifying the purpose of a corporate taxpayer, it is important indeed decisive to consider the purpose of those who control the taxpayer: Ruhamah 41 CLR at 160, 162, 166; Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 370. So, for example, in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 where ownership and control of the taxpayer company changed from that of individuals whose purpose in forming the taxpayer was for the taxpayer to hold land for the domestic purposes of those shareholders, to that of three companies which acquired the taxpayer for the purpose of carrying out a business operation of land development, a key issue in the decision was the fact of that change of control and the intentions of the new shareholders of the taxpayer. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.033,0.897,0.9996,6.461600000000001
Case1362,Deniz v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1983) 51 ALR 645,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1365,GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124,"In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital.

Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337.

The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345).

Case1367,Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342).

Case1368,Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case.

Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 48 In its Notice of Appeal, the applicant linked this question of law with paras 27-30 and para 35 of the Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal. In these paragraphs, in the context of considering whether the loss the applicant sought to carry forward was more appropriately characterised as a capital or income loss, Senior Member McCabe said as follows: 27. Section 14ZZK(b) says the taxpayer has the burden of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently. The Commissioner's decision effectively creates a presumption the applicant must rebut if he or she is to succeed in an appeal: see, for example, McCormack v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 at 314-315 per Jacobs J. That may be a difficult task where the taxpayer does not call any witnesses to explain a paper trail that does not speak for itself, or which is consistent with the Commissioner's view or even ambiguous. 28. The Commissioner has asked me to draw adverse inferences against the taxpayer in light of the fact the applicant has not called Mr D to give evidence. Mr D was in the best position to explain the transactions into which the applicant entered. His evidence would probably have been of assistance to the Tribunal. Mr Hack, for the Commissioner, says the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 should apply. That rule permits me to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call the witness in appropriate circumstances. One of the circumstances in which I may not draw an adverse inference is where there is a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness. I think there is a reasonable excuse in this case. That excuse can be gleaned from the submissions made in relation to the application for a suppression order: see A Taxpayer and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 398. Mr D has apparently declined to answer questions on the basis he might expose himself to a criminal prosecution. There is little point in calling a witness in those circumstances. 29. While I decline to draw an adverse inference from Mr D's failure to appear, that failure inevitably makes it harder for the applicant to show the Commissioner's decision was wrong. 30. The starting point of the analysis is the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v NF Williams (1972) 72 ATC 4188 per Gibb J at 4195. If the asset was more like trading stock that was bought and sold (or bought, developed, sub-divided and sold) as part of a business of developing and dealing in land, the law might treat the proceeds of the sale as income : see, for example, Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1982) 82 ATC 4031. ... 35. I have already observed the applicant would have difficulty establishing the Commissioner's objection decisions were wrong the task required of the applicant by s 14ZZK of the TAA in circumstances where the taxpayer did not call any witnesses and relied instead on inferences drawn from the evidence. I do not think the applicant has discharged that burden. The applicant has not persuaded me the land was anything other than a capital asset. The proceeds of the sale of the land should therefore be regarded as the proceeds of a mere realisation of a capital asset. The loss on that sale was a capital loss. The objection decisions under review ought to be affirmed in that respect. 49 On consideration of the grounds of appeal, the applicant's submissions, and Reasons for Decision of the Tribunal highlighted by the applicant, two issues emerge, namely: a. whether the Tribunal incorrectly applied the onus of proof borne by the applicant; and b. whether the Tribunal improperly applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298. 55 In relation to the second issue concerning the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298, the applicant contends as a ground of appeal that the Tribunal erred in law by correctly ruling that the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298 did not apply, but then in fact applying that rule. The key aspect of this well-known rule for present purposes is that the unexplained failure by a party to call evidence or witnesses may, not must, in appropriate circumstances lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence or missing material would not have assisted that party's case (see Heydon JD, Cross on Evidence (7th Australian ed, Butterworths, 2004) at p 39. 56 Although the applicant also referred to paras 35, 39, 40, 41 and 49 of the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision in connection with this question of law, this contention is particularly relevant to paras 28 and 35 where the Tribunal: &#8226; noted the rule, but observed that it should not apply it because the applicant had a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness (para 28); and &#8226; said that the applicant had not discharged its burden of proof (para 35). 57 Paragraphs 39, 40, and 41 relate to carrying forward losses and continuity of beneficial ownership (and hence are relevant to question e), whereas para 49 refers to the penalty imposed on the applicant (which I have already considered) and the alleged prosecution of Mr Doumany which I will discuss later in this judgment. 58 In para 28, the Tribunal made it clear that the task of the applicant in discharging its burden of proof was made more difficult because it did not call Mr Doumany as a witness. However the Senior Member also made it clear that he made his decision based upon the evidence that was before him, and provided reasons to this effect. I am not persuaded that that the Tribunal in fact applied the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; 101 CLR 298, either unconsciously (as submitted by the applicant) or otherwise. Given the history of this matter, and Mr Doumany's involvement in the affairs of the applicant and all relevant transactions the subject of this application, it is obvious that his evidence would have been important in these proceedings. In light of this, contrary to the submissions of the applicant, there were very good reasons for the Tribunal to take the view that the failure of the applicant to call Mr Doumany as a witness made the applicant's task of discharging its burden of proof more difficult in these proceedings. However this does not mean that the Tribunal drew inferences adverse to the applicant from its failure to call Mr Doumany as a witness. Further, the examination by the Tribunal of whether the loss should be characterised as income or capital, including consideration of the facts as presented to the Tribunal, suggests that the Tribunal did in fact give careful consideration to such evidence as was before it. 59 Accordingly the answer to question d raised on appeal is ""No"". 60 I have a number of observations concerning questions e and f.

Case1370,Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia.

(These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment.

Case1371,McAuliffe v Comcare [2002] FCA 769,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

The Commissioner has asked me to draw adverse inferences against the taxpayer in light of the fact the applicant has not called Mr D to give evidence. Mr D was in the best position to explain the transactions into which the applicant entered. His evidence would probably have been of assistance to the Tribunal. Mr Hack, for the Commissioner, says the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 should apply. That rule permits me to draw an adverse inference from the failure to call the witness in appropriate circumstances. One of the circumstances in which I may not draw an adverse inference is where there is a reasonable excuse for the failure to call the witness. I think there is a reasonable excuse in this case. That excuse can be gleaned from the submissions made in relation to the application for a suppression order: see A Taxpayer and Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 398. Mr D has apparently declined to answer questions on the basis he might expose himself to a criminal prosecution. There is little point in calling a witness in those circumstances. 29. While I decline to draw an adverse inference from Mr D's failure to appear, that failure inevitably makes it harder for the applicant to show the Commissioner's decision was wrong. 30. The starting point of the analysis is the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v NF Williams (1972) 72 ATC 4188 per Gibb J at 4195. If the asset was more like trading stock that was bought and sold (or bought, developed, sub-divided and sold) as part of a business of developing and dealing in land, the law might treat the proceeds of the sale as income : see, for example, Whitfords Beach Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1982) 82 ATC 4031. ... 35. I have already observed the applicant would have difficulty establishing the Commissioner's objection decisions were wrong the task required of the applicant by s 14ZZK of the TAA in circumstances where the taxpayer did not call any witnesses and relied instead on inferences drawn from the evidence. I do not think the applicant has discharged that burden. The applicant has not persuaded me the land was anything other than a capital asset. The proceeds of the sale of the land should therefore be regarded as the proceeds of a mere realisation of a capital asset. The loss on that sale was a capital loss. The objection decisions under review ought to be affirmed in that respect. 51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] . 53 In my view, this misconceives the obligation of the taxpayer when challenging a determination of the Commissioner under the legislation, and the onus borne by the taxpayer as a result of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act . As Jacobs J explained in McCormack 143 CLR at 314, there is, by virtue of the section, a rebuttable presumption of law that an assessment is not excessive, and the onus is on the taxpayer to rebut that presumption. This means, for example, that where the evidence is equivocal the applicant in an appeal before the Tribunal against an assessment fails to discharge its onus : Mason J in Gauci v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 89-90, approved in McCormack 143 CLR by Gibbs J at 303-304, Stephen J at 306, Jacobs J at 314 and Murphy J at 323. Contending that the onus of proof under s 14ZZK(b) only arises in the limited circumstances submitted by the applicant misstates the effect of that provision. In my view no error of law appears in this respect from paras 27-30 and 35 of the Tribunal's Reasons for Decision.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.08,0.061,0.859,0.9674,6.3669

Implicit in its powers are a number of restrictions. The appeal is expressly limited to error of law, which alleged error is the sole matter before this Court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal. The order which this Court can make after hearing the appeal is also similarly restricted to an order which is appropriate by reason of its decision. It follows that the only order which can be properly made is one the propriety of which is circumscribed by and necessary to reflect this Court's view on the alleged or found error of law. To go further I would see as amounting to exceeding the jurisdiction of this Court under this section. A power to make 'such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision' is much more restrictive than a power 'to make such order as it sees fit' or a power 'to make a decision in substitution for the decision' the subject of the appeal.'...

Case1375,Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.073,0.035,0.891,0.9989,6.45515

Accordingly, ""intentional disregard"" of the ITAA 1936 or regulations requires, inter alia , an understanding by the taxpayer of the effect of the relevant legislation or regulations, an appreciation by the taxpayer of how that legislation or regulation applies to the circumstances of the taxpayer, and finally, deliberate conduct of the taxpayer so as to flout the ITAA 1936 or regulations. The legislation treats ""intentional disregard"" differently from, and more seriously than, negligence to comply with the Act (cf s 226G) or recklessness with regard to the correct operation of the Act (cf s 226H). 44 Whether the conduct of the applicant has satisfied s 226J requires findings of fact by the Tribunal.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.066,0.881,-0.373,1.7095000000000002

As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 62 The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1378,Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82,"Unfortunately question d was not the subject of oral submissions by the applicant during the hearing before me. Ms Brennan for the respondent however referred me to the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82. In that case however the Court noted that it was considering the principles of burden and onus of proof under s 120 (5) and (6) Veteran's Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ((1998) 83 FCR 82 at 95). 51 Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.073,0.028,0.9,0.9169,6.16715

In itself, the question does not cavil with the legal approach of the Tribunal to the conceptualisation of continuity of beneficial ownership. In my view question e is not a question of law which attracts the jurisdiction of the Court under s 44(1) AAT Act . Does question f raise a question of law 66 Similarly, question f queries the finding of the Tribunal with respect to whether the applicant was carrying on the same business during the relevant period, without disputing the approach by the Tribunal to the issue. Question f seems to seek a review of the decision of the Tribunal purely on the facts. In my view, for the reasons I have just outlined, question f also does not raise a question of law.

Case1380,Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income.

There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.072,0.038,0.89,0.9984,6.4604
Case1381,Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case.

So, for example, in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 where ownership and control of the taxpayer company changed from that of individuals whose purpose in forming the taxpayer was for the taxpayer to hold land for the domestic purposes of those shareholders, to that of three companies which acquired the taxpayer for the purpose of carrying out a business operation of land development, a key issue in the decision was the fact of that change of control and the intentions of the new shareholders of the taxpayer.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.07,0.037,0.893,0.9984,6.4614

As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.072,0.038,0.89,0.9984,6.4604

Case1385,Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.036,0.894,0.9993,6.46155

There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1387,United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.072,0.038,0.89,0.9984,6.4604
Case1388,Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889,"Like in the case before me, the applicable legislation in Deledio was not silent on issues of proof. In relation to the first issue in this case with respect to onus of proof, it is clear in light of s 14ZZK(b)(i) TA Act that the taxpayer in this case bore the onus of proof that the amended assessment was excessive. The nature of the onus of proof in the context of this legislation has been recognised in numerous decisions, including McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284 (although McCormack was decided under predecessor legislation), Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Munro (1997) 97 ATC 5041 and Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889. Further, it is clear on the authorities that the taxpayer, in its application before the Tribunal, must prove its case affirmatively on the balance of probabilities: McCormack 143 CLR at 303 per Gibbs J, Munro 97 ATC 5041, Vu v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 889 at [8] .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.105,0.011,0.884,0.9531,6.2418499999999995
Case1389,Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54,"The authorities are clear that: &#8226; On administrative review under the AAT Act the Tribunal is the arbiter of the facts: Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 82 ALR 352 at 357. Accordingly, in exercising its jurisdiction under s 44(1) AAT Act the task of the Court is to leave to the Tribunal decisions of fact, and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law ( Thompson , Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 115 ALR 1, Phillips v Commissioner for Superannuation [2005] FCAFC 2 , Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift (1989) 89 ATC 5101). There is no error in law simply in making a wrong finding of fact (Brennan J in Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77, Thompson at 357). This point has been reiterated many times (see for example Pozzolanic at 9 and Phillips at [41]). &#8226; Simply disputing factual findings of the Tribunal on the weight of evidence does not raise errors of law in the absence of other circumstances. As pointed out by the Full Court in Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601: A number of authorities were cited by counsel for the appellant in support of the propositions that the making of a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence and the making of an unreasonable decision are errors of law. We find it unnecessary to examine these authorities for the reason that, in our opinion, there is no factual basis to found these propositions. We would, however, comment that the concepts of a decision being against the evidence and of being against the weight of the evidence belong to appeals from courts of law and have particular application to jury verdicts. Even in that context, they do not involve questions of law. They certainly have no place when the appeal, or review, is of proceedings of an administrative tribunal which is not bound by the rules of evidence and which, subject to the obligation to observe the requirements of natural justice, can inform itself as it chooses: see s 33(1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 . An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to error of law must show, if he is to succeed, that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based.

Case1390,Westfield Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333,"The applicant lodged notices of objection against the ATO assessments and the penalty imposed. As indicated earlier in this judgment, on 27 September 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicant's objections. TRIBUNAL DECISION 5 In the Tribunal, the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows: 1. The applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profit-making venture. However the learned Senior Member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicant's business activity (Reasons for Decision para 34), and was of the view that the land was a capital asset, with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss (para 35). 2. The applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward, on the basis that the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A ITAA 1936 had been satisfied, and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with Mr Paul Doumany; or that the ""same business"" test in s 80E ITAA 1936 had been satisfied. The Senior Member observed that, given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicant's business activity and the resultant loss, it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues. In any event however, the Senior Member was satisfied that: &#8226; while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with Mr Doumany, at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in Mr Iwasaki, having been transferred to Mr Iwasaki on or before 20 December 1991. Accordingly the applicant failed on the ""continuity of ownership"" test in s 80A (para 40 ); and &#8226; there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between November 1992 and 1996, and the applicant therefore failed on the ""same business"" test in s 80E (para 45 ). 3 . The Tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently: s 14ZZK(b) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (""TA Act"") (para 27). Although the Senior Member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 (para 28), he noted that the failure of Mr Doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the Commissioner's decision was wrong (para 29). 4. The applicant contended that a penalty of 75% was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel. However the Senior Member was satisfied that the penalty of 75% under s 226J ITAA 1936 was appropriate (para 50). QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED ON APPEAL 6 The questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows: a. are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 51(1) ITAA 1936? b. if yes to a., in the relevant years of income: i did s 80A ITAA 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions?; or ii did s 80E ITAA 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions? c. if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions, were penalties correctly imposed under s 226J ITAA 1936? d. did the Tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicant's onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision? e. did the Tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares? f. did the Tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80E? g. could a reasonable tribunal have made, on the material before it, the findings made? h. does the Tribunal's apparent error of fact namely that Mr Doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the Tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it, or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant? 7 I shall address each of these questions in turn. a. ARE THE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE APPLICANT ALLOWABLE AS DEDUCTIONS UNDER SECTION 51(1) ITAA 1936? 8 As the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 51(1) ITAA 1936. 9 The applicant submitted that: &#8226; the Tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found &#8226; the Tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account, which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale . This, the applicant submitted, was the relevant inquiry, not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account &#8226; the Tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. &#8226; the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development, with the land being trading stock: Moana Sand Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4897. In particular, the applicant submitted that in Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897, the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayer's purposes was profit-making by subdivision and sale, even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition. The applicant also cited in support of its case Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooling (1990) 22 FCR 42 and Westfield Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 333. 10 In response, the Commissioner submitted that: &#8226; the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 51(1) is that the loss is ""incidental and relevant"" to the income-earning operations of the taxpayer &#8226; the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicant's gaining or producing assessable income, or the carrying on of its business &#8226; the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact &#8226; citing Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation v Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; (1972) 127 CLR 226 at 249, proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income, even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price. However, a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset, and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset, as was the case in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 8 ; (1982) 150 CLR 355 &#8226; the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26(a) ITAA 1936 and was of no application in this case. The land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in September 1985 and s 26(a), the more recent s 25A and s 52 have no application to the transaction &#8226; profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income &#8226; in this case the Tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision, development and sale, and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355 (Reasons for Decision para 32). Section 51(1) ITAA 1936 11 This section has been interpreted many times, and at the highest judicial level in Australia. At the relevant time it read as follows: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income. 12 In the context of the section it is clear that: &#8226; the expression ""incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income"" requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income, or if none be produced, would be expected to produce assessable income: Ronpibon Tin NL v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 57 &#8226; the reference to losses and outgoings ""necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income"" adds little to the operation of the leading words ""losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"": Ronpibon Tin 78 CLR at 56 &#8226; losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. 13 In the case before the Senior Member, a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income. If the loss was a capital loss, it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 51(1). Capital vs income 14 In a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex, the issue in question before the Senior Member was one of deceptive simplicity. Were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenue/income? Despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital (to paraphrase Wilson J in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring) the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case. Before turning to the decision of Senior Member McCabe, it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question. Definitions 15 Despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of ""income"" and ""capital"" for the purposes of Commonwealth taxation legislation, neither term is legislatively defined. It is clear that, because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital, the term ""income"" has not extended to all forms of gain; nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss (for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by Professor Jeff Waincymer ""If at first you don't succeed... reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena"" (1994) 19 MULR 977). However as observed by Jordan CJ in Scott v Commissioner of Taxation (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at 219 in relation to ""income"": The word ""income"" is not a term of art, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind, except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts... 16 A consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time, with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of ""statutory income"" in the ITAA 1936 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in Australia. However, notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction (note for example comments of Greene MR in Inland Revenue Commissioners v British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd [1938] 2 KB 482 at 498) the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases. 17 This matter is one such case. As I have already noted, the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital, but subsequently, and now before the Court, claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles. There was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue. 18 The traditional delineation between income and capital, so far as referable to outgoings, was described by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1939) 61 CLR 337 at 359, 363 as follows: The distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity, structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay, the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or loss...There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment. (These principles have been considered and applied many times by Australian courts: see for example Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 645-646; Williams [1972] HCA 31 ; 127 CLR 226, Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, United Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 78 FCR 169 per Sundberg and Merkel JJ at 191-192; Lamont v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 513 ; Macquarie Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 205 at [105-106] , and Commissioner of Taxation v Citylink Melbourne Ltd [2006] HCA 35 per Crennan J (Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ agreeing) at [147-154] and per Kirby J at [20-25].) 19 I shall return to this principle later in this judgment. Capital or revenue and real property 20 Real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset. Generally speaking, unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind. The courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer, in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset, was capital or income, in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset (in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain), or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making (in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue): see for example California Copper Syndicate v Harris (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166, Commissioner of Taxes v Melbourne Trust Limited [1914] AC 1001 at 1009, Ruhamah Property Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1928] HCA 22 ; (1928) 41 CLR 148 at 151, and Whitford's Beach 150 CLR per Gibbs CJ at 367-368, Mason J at 372, Wilson J at 400. 26 Although the High Court in Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 found that receipts from sale of capital assets generated as profit components of profit-making schemes were capable of constituting income, equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income. As pointed out by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Spedley Securities Ltd (1988) 19 ATR 938 at 942, such a proposition would be contrary to authority, to the Act itself, and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income (note similar comments by the Hill J in Cooling 22 FCR at 55 and again by Hill J (with whom the other members of the Court concurred) in Westfield 28 FCR at 342). Nature of purpose 27 In determining whether a sale receipt is generated as a profit component of a profit-making scheme, and therefore income in accordance with ordinary usages, it is only necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale was one aspect of a profit-making scheme in existence at the time of the acquisition of the asset (or, as was the case in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355, coming into existence during the course of the taxpayer's ownership of the asset and remaining in existence at the time of the sale): Westfield 28 FCR at 343-344. It is not necessary that the intention or purpose of profit-making by sale be the sole or dominant purpose of the taxpayer entering into the profit-making scheme: Cooling 22 FCR at 56-57 (cf Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199 where the motivating purpose of the transaction was for Myer to obtain working capital to enable it to diversify; and Moana Sand 88 ATC 4897 where the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in acquiring the land was not resale of the land at a profit). However the Full Court of the Federal Court in a number of cases has indicated that the purpose of profit-making must be a ""not insignificant"" aspect of the taxpayer's activities: Cooling 22 FCR at 57, Selleck v Commissioner of Taxation [1997] 799 FCA (20 August 1997). 28 The meaning of ""profit-making scheme"" is well-known. It is useful to note in the present context that: &#8226; it is not necessary that the profit-making scheme was specific in detail, or that every step which culminated in the profit was planned or foreseen ( Westfield 28 FCR at 344); and &#8226; the mode of achieving that profit must be one contemplated by the taxpayer as at least one of the alternatives by which the profit could be realised ( Westfield 28 FCR at 344). 29 As Hill J further noted in Westfield 28 FCR at 333-345: (I)t is difficult to conceive of a case where a taxpayer would be said to have made a profit from the carrying on, or carrying out, of a profit-making scheme, where, in the case of the scheme involving the acquisition and resale of land, there was, at the time of acquisition, no purpose of resale of land, but only the possibility (present, one may observe, in the case of every acquisition of land) that the land may be resold. The same may be said to be the case where s 25(1) of the Act is involved. As the court observed in Myer...the property which generates the gain must be acquired in an operation of business or commercial transaction 'for the purposes of profit-making by the means giving rise to the profit. Whose purpose 34 In my view the submissions of the applicant that the Tribunal erred in law in its findings respect of this issue cannot be supported. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. Senior Member McCabe stated the law correctly when he referred to ""the well-established rule that the proceeds from the 'mere realisation' of a capital asset will not give rise to income according to ordinary concepts and any loss incurred on the disposal of the asset will not lead to a loss that can be offset against other income of the taxpayer"". This is clearly supported by the body of case law to which I referred earlier in this judgment, beginning with California Copper (1904) 5 TC 159. 2. The applicant in its submissions contended that the Senior Member erred in making the inquiry as to whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account. However: &#8226; I note from the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions filed by the applicant in the Tribunal that the applicant had contended that the loss incurred by the applicant on the sale of the land in the year ended 30 June 1993 was a revenue loss by reason either of the trading stock provisions or as a loss on a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Further, the evidence showed that LGHH, in its letter of 14 July 1994 to the ATO on behalf of the applicant, described the land as ""trading stock"". In light of this it is to be expected that the Senior Member would address the issue whether the land was trading stock or the gross proceeds were on revenue account (paras 30-31). &#8226; In any event, in my view it is clear from reading para 30 of the Reasons for Decision that the Senior Member, in referring to the situation ""if the asset was more like trading stock"", was giving an example of a scenario where the proceeds of sale of capital assets such as real property can properly be characterised as income rather than capital. The Senior Member did not base his decision that the loss in this case was not in the nature of revenue, solely on this principle. 3. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in that it did not refer to what the applicant defined as the relevant inquiry in the circumstances, namely whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profit-making by sale. The applicant submitted further that, in failing to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land was acquired as part of a profit-making undertaking, the Tribunal also failed to direct itself as to whether one of the purposes of its acquisition, rather than the purpose, was profit-making by sale. However, in my view the Senior Member made it clear that he had applied the test of whether the applicant had acquired the land with a profit-making purpose, but that in doing so as a finding of fact he was not satisfied that the applicant had had that purpose at all , ie as either ""the"" purpose or one of a number of purposes be they significant or otherwise. Rather, the Tribunal considered the range of purposes of acquisition of the land and the characterisation of the applicant's business activity as submitted by the applicant, and on the facts found against the applicant. This is apparent from the Reasons for Decision, including: &#8226; At para 31, where the Senior Member specifically acknowledged: ""The applicant says this was a profit-making venture... The company acquired the land with a view to developing it or on-selling the property to another entity. The company investigated various development options before completing a sale and then distributed a portion of the proceeds to the foreign businessman"". &#8226; At para 32, where the Senior Member specifically stated: ""I am not persuaded by that characterisation of the company's business activity. The taxpayer was a shelf company until it contracted to purchase a parcel of land from a foreign businessman who was a client of one of the company's directors. The correspondence between the businessman's solicitors and the FIRB make it clear the property was acquired by the businessman to construct accommodation. As it happened, that was the only use to which the property was ever put... The taxpayer did investigate whether the property could be sub-divided or on-sold for the purposes of development, but I do not think the evidence establishes that was the purpose for which the land was acquired."" 4. Although the applicant submitted that the findings of the Tribunal in para 32 of its Reasons for Decisions namely that the applicant had considered sub-division or on-sale for the purposes of development as one option and that steps were taken to achieve that purpose required the Tribunal to conclude that the loss on sale of the applicant's land was deductible under s 51(1), I do not so find. Rather, in my view: &#8226; The finding of the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case that the proceeds from the sale of the land were on capital account rather than income is consistent with the legal principles as articulated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers [1938] HCA 72 ; 61 CLR 337. The land was purchased by Mr Iwasaki, transferred to the applicant, and used for the purposes of constructing student accommodation which in turn generated income. It bore all the hallmarks of a capital asset. The fact that the applicant was a corporate entity does not mean that any disposal of asset is on revenue account ( Myer Emporium [1987] HCA 18 ; 163 CLR 199). &#8226; In any event, as found by the Tribunal, Mr Iwasaki was the directing mind and will of the applicant between 1991 when the land was transferred to the applicant, and 1993 when Mr Iwasaki relinquished any claim he may have had as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant following the sale of the land. Accordingly, during that period, the purpose of Mr Iwasaki with respect to the land was the relevant purpose (cf Whitfords Beach [1961] HCA 25 ; 105 CLR 355; Austin RP and Ramsay IM, Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13th ed, Butterworths, 2007) Ch 16; Lipton P and Herzberg A, Understanding Company Law (13th ed, Law Book Co, 2006) at pp 103-108). That purpose as found by the Tribunal was bi-fold, namely that the land was a capital asset to be used for constructing student accommodation, and the applicant was to hold the land on Mr Iwasaki's behalf as part of the re-ordering of Mr Iwasaki's affairs. As found by the Tribunal, other than consideration of the option of development of the land, neither Mr Iwasaki nor the applicant at the relevant time held the land for the purpose of resale consistent with a profit-making scheme (cf Hill J in Westfield 28 FCR at 344-345). Further, as found by the Tribunal at para 32, there was no change of purpose of the applicant with respect to the land, as evinced, for example, by steps towards further development of the property, so as to result in the applicant acquiring a profit-making purpose akin to the situation in Whitford's Beach [1982] HCA 8 ; 150 CLR 355. &#8226; Notwithstanding the submissions of the applicant, in my view the law is not that, in the absence of a clear intention of a taxpayer in acquiring the property that it be used for a profit-making purpose, any subsequent consideration by the taxpayer of exploitation of a capital asset (for example by the possible options of either subdivision or on-selling) results in the immediate creation of a profit-making scheme and the resultant characterisation of profits or losses made in respect of subsequent dealings with that asset as revenue. A bare claim that this was the intention of the taxpayer is insufficient to manifest that intention in the absence of evidence of that intention, for example, by steps to progress those options. The surrounding circumstances must be taken into account in ascertaining the true intention of the taxpayer, and also characterising the receipts in the hands of the taxpayer. To find otherwise would potentially sanction any manifestation of intention of the taxpayer to convert a capital asset to the revenue account (or vice versa), however meagre or fleeting such manifestation of intention. By analogy I note comments of the High Court in GP International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1990) 170 CLR 124 at 142 where their Honours said: ... it cannot be accepted that an intention on the part of a payer and a payee or either of them that a receipt be applied to recoup capital expenditure by the payee determines the character of a receipt when the circumstances show that the payment is received in consideration of the performance of a contract, the performance of which is the business of the recipient or which is performed in the ordinary course of the business of the recipient.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.074,0.033,0.892,0.9997,6.45495

As Lockhart J said in Whitaker v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 261 at 269: 'The primary purpose of an award of pre-judgment interest is to compensate a successful plaintiff for the loss or detriment which he or she has suffered by being kept out of his or her money during the relevant period; that is to compensate the plaintiff for having been deprived of the use of the money: Ruby v Marsh [1975] HCA 32 ; (1975) 132 CLR 642 ; Batchelor v Burke [1981] HCA 30 ; (1981) 148 CLR 448 ; and MBP (SA) Pty Limited v Gogic [1991] HCA 3 ; (1991) 171 CLR 657. See P D Finn (ed), Essays on Damages (1st ed, 1992) and in particular the essay by J L R Davis, ""Interest as Compensation"", pp 149-152.' The applicant has been without its money since 28 January 2004 and that remains the case. It is only appropriate that it should have interest on that money up to the date of judgment. 11 The motion for the vacation of Order 6 is dismissed. 12 The respondents' notice of motion seeks (at [2]) the vacation of Orders 7 and 8 made on 30 July 2008 and their variation based on the matters set out in the affidavit of Ms Ellis sworn 5 August 2005. It does not say how they should be varied. Nor do their written submissions. What the respondents' notice of motion does seek (at [3]) is an order that the applicant pay the respondents' costs (on an indemnity or, alternatively, party-party basis) from 21 April 2007 or such other time as the Court thinks fit. On the hearing of the motion, the further alternative was introduced, namely, that each party pay its own costs from that date. Presumably, implicit in all this is that the first, second and third respondents should pay the applicant's costs of the application as ordered by Order 7, but only up to 21 April 2007. On the hearing of the motion, nothing was said about the second limb of Order 7, namely, that the first, second and third respondents pay the fourth, fifth and sixth respondents' costs of defending the application. Nor was anything said about Order 8 that the cross-claimant pay the first and second cross-respondents' costs of defending the cross-claim.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.039,0.035,0.926,0.5671,4.98085

See: Luck J, Case Note (1990) 1 IPJ 63. 132 The first contention advanced on behalf of Gallo Winery was that the prior registered owner of the trade mark, Mr Houlihan, licensed it to Barefoot Cellars and exercised quality control over the BAREFOOT wine to which the mark was applied. The fact that such wines were sold and offered for sale by Beach Avenue Wholesalers during the relevant period -- it was submitted -- was sufficient to constitute a use of the mark by Barefoot Cellars and, in turn, Mr Houlihan. That was a "" use "", so it was contended, by the then registered proprietor during the non-use period. 133 Neither Mr Houlihan nor any officer of Barefoot Cellars knew that the BAREFOOT wine exported to Germany in 2001 may ultimately find its way to Australia. But knowledge on the part of Mr Houlihan or Barefoot Cellars that its wine would or may find its way to Australia and be offered for sale, is said by Gallo Winery to be irrelevant. 137 Notwithstanding the views expressed by those authors, it is not considered that there could have been a "" use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark during the 2004 2007 period by the registered owner simply by reason of the fact that BAREFOOT wine happened to be offered for sale or was in fact sold in Australia during that period. 138 There was certainly no agreement or other arrangement as between either Mr Houlihan or Barefoot Cellars and Beach Avenue Wholesalers whereby the BAREFOOT wine was to be imported, whether from Germany or elsewhere, and later sold or offered for sale in Australia. 139 In the circumstances of the present proceedings, it is not considered that there was any "" use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark by the registered proprietor in Australia arising merely by reason of the fact that the BAREFOOT wine, or some of the wine exported originally to Germany, by some unexplained circuitous route ultimately arrived on Australian shores and was thereafter available for sale in Australia.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.076,0.042,0.882,0.985,6.4135

Case1397,Buying Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd v Studio Srl [1995] FCA 1063 ; (1995) 30 IPR 517,"These negotiations, contends Gallo Winery , constituted a use of the BAREFOOT trade mark in Australia. Such negotiations, contends Gallo Winery , provide evidence which is at least as strong, if not stronger, than that which constituted a use in Buying Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd v Studio Srl [1995] FCA 1063 ; (1995) 30 IPR 517. 164 In Buying Systems there was activity aimed at setting up a new fashion magazine. That activity included obtaining business cards, printing letterheads, and obtaining advertising space. Gummow J concluded (at 520): These steps amount to sufficient activity by the opponent to produce the result that the applicant for registration at the date of its application on 8 December 1983 could not accurately put itself forward as claiming to be proprietor of the relevant mark. The activities of the opponent were sufficient to constitute a relevant use of the mark in Australia for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between it and the new magazine. This is not a case where those activities occurred without any existing intention to offer or supply the magazine in trade. The case is quite different from activities of the nature discussed in Moorgate. As I have already indicated, the material before this court is far more extensive than that which was before the registrar. 166 Buying Systems , it is considered, provides no support to the case now sought to be advanced by Gallo Winery. Reference may also be made to NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (No 1) (1989) 14 IPR 26. Gummow J there concluded that there had been a use of the mark in issue by reason of such facts during the statutory period as the provision of art work to enable the manufacture of packaging and the production of promotional videos. 167 In the present proceedings there were undoubtedly discussions between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines as to the launch in Australia of BAREFOOT wine. But by May 2007 the negotiations had not proceeded beyond just that, negotiations. Compare: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [40] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 179. There was unquestionably an intention to launch BAREFOOT wine in Australia "" in around September 2007 "". But, and unlike the position in Buying Systems , there had been no step taken during the non-use period comparable to the placing of advertisements or the printing of letterheads or business cards. The only step which had been taken was the unilateral step taken by McWilliams Wines to allocate some of its wine. Gallo Winery was pleased that such a step had been taken as it preserved the possibility of a launch in September 2007. That was a step taken, however, by McWilliams Wines and not by Gallo Winery.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.015,0.012,0.972,0.3567,4.24245
Case1398,"C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 , 52 IPR 42","The comparison, it should be noted, is different to that undertaken in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around a mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception, or perhaps merely confusion, and the consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff: Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89 at 128 9 per Gummow J. Essentially what is required when considering whether a mark is deceptively similar to another is a comparison between the mark of the registered owner and that of the alleged infringer: C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [44] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 62. Ryan, Branson and Lehane JJ there considered that it was not appropriate to undertake a wider inquiry of the kind undertaken in a passing off action or in a proceeding in which a contravention of Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is alleged. 198 The discretion presently conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act, it has been said, confers a "" broad discretion "": C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [72] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 73. And it is a discretion, it is considered, no longer constrained by any requirement to establish "" exceptional circumstances ""; it is a discretion which may be exercised "" when it is reasonable to do so "": Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 , 223 ALR 27. Lander J there indicated that he was of the view that it was not reasonable not to remove the mark in issue. Of the discretion, his Honour concluded: [97] ... There are significant differences in the section considered by the Court of Appeal in Lyons [(1959) 76 RPC 120] and s 101(3). In the English section, regard had to be had to the bona fide use of the trade mark during the relevant period. No such regard is had in s 101(3). It is always dangerous to have regard to a statement of principle in relation to the exercise of a discretion in a section in an Act which is not in pari materia with a section of a second Act for the purpose of considering the way in which a discretion should be exercised in that second Act. [98] In Upjohn [(1998) 42 IPR 576] it was said that the power may be applied in ""exceptional circumstances"". Section 101(3) does not say that. There is no warrant to read the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" into the subsection. That would be to give the subsection a construction contrary to its express terms. In my opinion, the discretion which is to be exercised under s 101(3) is to be exercised as the subsection itself says, ""when it is reasonable to do so"". To suggest that the party against whom the non-use has been put in a case such as this should establish exceptional circumstances is to put too high a hurdle in that party's path. 207 The present proceedings, it is considered, stand in stark contrast to those confronting both the trial judge and the Full Court in C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 , 52 IPR 42. The trial judge there had indicated that he would have allowed the mark to remain registered, even had it not been used. The registered proprietor of the mark had died in 1972 and no steps had been taken to transfer the mark until 1997. The beneficial interest in the mark had at all times resided directly or indirectly in members of the Henschke family. The only "" formal "" deception which could be pointed to was an impression that it may have been the partnership, rather than the executors, who owned the "" Hill of Grace "" trade mark. The persons using the mark were the persons who gave the mark its value.

Trade mark law, it has been recognised, is more complex than is suggested by the proposition that the supreme -- or, at least -- a predominant interest is the maintenance of the integrity of the Register: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 at [40] , [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 65. Speaking of the 1955 Act, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ there pointed out the balance struck by the legislation between various interests. Both the interests of the consuming public and the interests of traders have to be recognised. Their Honours observed that: [42] ... the Australian legislation has manifested from time to time a varying accommodation of commercial and the consuming public's interests. There is the interest of consumers in recognising a trade mark as a badge of origin of goods or services and in avoiding deception or confusion as to that origin. There is the interest of traders, both in protecting their goodwill through the creation of a statutory species of property protected by the action against infringement, and in turning this property to valuable account by licensing or assignment. The provisions of the 1955 Act with respect to defensive registrations and certification marks were recognitions that the interests of the owners of registered trade marks may go beyond that of indicating trade origin. In Yale Electric Corporation v Robertson [(1928) 26 F 2d 972 at 973], Judge Learned Hand said of this interest: ""that one merchant shall not divert customers from another by representing what he sells as emanating from the second. This has been, and perhaps even more now is, the whole Law and the Prophets on the subject, though it assumes many guises."" In this decade, legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and now in Australia to varying degrees has extended the infringement action to restrain activities which are likely adversely to affect the interests of the owner of a ""famous"" or ""well-known"" trade mark by the ""dilution"" of its distinctive qualities or of its value to the owner.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.148,0.037,0.815,0.9926,6.363099999999999

See: Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Ltd (1994) 120 ALR 495 at 510 per Gummow J. 152 The second way in which Gallo Winery contends that there has been a use of the mark during the non-use period is again to rely upon the fact that BAREFOOT wine was sold by Beach Avenue Wholesalers and offered for sale during the non-use period. This, together with the quality control exercised by Mr Houlihan, it is submitted, made Beach Avenue Wholesalers an "" authorised user "" of the mark within the meaning of s 8(1) of the 1995 Act. Its use of the mark, it is contended, is an "" authorised use "" within the meaning of s 8(2). 153 Section 8 of the 1995 Act provides as follows: Definitions of authorised user and authorised use (1) A person is an authorised user of a trade mark if the person uses the trade mark in relation to goods or services under the control of the owner of the trade mark. (2) The use of a trade mark by an authorised user of the trade mark is an authorised use of the trade mark to the extent only that the user uses the trade mark under the control of the owner of the trade mark. (3) If the owner of a trade mark exercises quality control over goods or services: (a) dealt with or provided in the course of trade by another person; and (b) in relation to which the trade mark is used; the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade mark in relation to the goods or services under the control of the owner. (4) If: (a) a person deals with or provides, in the course of trade, goods or services in relation to which a trade mark is used; and (b) the owner of the trade mark exercises financial control over the other person's relevant trading activities; the other person is taken, for the purposes of subsection (1), to use the trade mark in relation to the goods or services under the control of the owner.

While a mere possibility of confusion is not enough--for there must be a real, tangible danger of its occurring ... --it is sufficient if the result of the user of the mark will be that a number of persons will be caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt. ...

Case1402,"Colorado Group Ltd v Standbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 , 243 ALR 127","Lion Nathan placed reliance upon Colorado Group Ltd v Standbags Group Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 184 , 164 FCR 506. Just as in the Colorado case, Lion Nathan contends that the image cannot be divorced from the word such that the words alone had the capacity to distinguish the wine. In reaching a like conclusion in the Colorado case, Allsop J concluded: [110] Here, though the evidence was less than precise as to what the mark plus device use was by CGL, the examples in evidence reveal an important, perhaps even dominant, effect of the word ""Colorado"", but always with a device. That device was part of the trade mark use; it had a capacity to distinguish. It did not, in my view, operate as a separate mark, nor as a mere descriptor. It operated as part of a combination with the word ""Colorado"", in part reinforcing it. In these circumstances, I agree with the primary judge's concluded view that though the word ""Colorado"" is important in the impression, it cannot be said to have been used alone, rather than as part of a composite mark (with the device) to show origin. Kenny and Gyles JJ gave separate judgments but also agreed with Allsop J. 186 Although it may be accepted that a combination of a word and an image may in some circumstances strip, in the mind of a consumer, the association with a trade source previously associated with the word alone, such is not the present case. Rejected is the contention of Lion Nathan that -- if there was a use of a trade mark during the non-use period -- it was the use of a mark other than the word "" BAREFOOT "" . If there was a use of a mark during the non-use period, the addition of the image of the bare foot did not have the consequence that the word itself as a trade mark was not also being used. 187 One of the final contentions advanced by Gallo Winery was that any such use as there was of the trade mark during the non-use period was a use "" in good faith "" within the meaning of s 100(1)(c) of the 1995 Act. 188 Lion Nathan denies that any use was a use "" in good faith "". Upon its analysis, during the non-use period there were 59 bottles provided to customers, of which 18 were given away free.

The word "" RADLER "", it is considered, would leave an impression on the mind of a person who knew what the word meant and would leave an even firmer impression upon the mind of a person who had no such knowledge.

Notwithstanding the distinctiveness which the word "" RADLER "" brings to the sign of Lion Nathan , it would not be sufficient to remove the likelihood of deception otherwise arising. 64 Again, it should be noted, any deceptive similarity with the Gallo Winery mark would not have arisen had Lion Nathan been free to rely upon the combination of words and the image of the bare foot.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.052,0.068,0.88,-0.5662,1.0343

Of these decisions, it is of significance to note that in the Australian Wine Importers case the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a decision of Kay J. Cotton LJ held at 316: ... Well, it is not confined to the same goods, but it is ""the same goods or description of goods ;"" and if it were necessary to decide it absolutely on that point, my opinion would be that there was an application for registration with respect to the same description of goods ; because although wine and whiskey, and wine and spirits are in a great many ways considered as different goods, yet we are not considering here how chemists would describe them, but whether manufacturers would describe them as being the same description of goods or not. We find that they are goods which are generally sold by the same persons, and for the purposes of trade may, in some respects, be considered as the same description of goods; for they are both alcoholic, and although there may be differences in them, they may fairly be considered as coming within the same description of goods, though they are not the same goods. ... Lindley LJ similarly concluded at 318 19: Of course one has to look at the trade. One must look at it from a business point of view. They are alcoholic and spirituous. They are sold in this country constantly by the same people. Wine and spirit dealers are common enough in this country, and I am not sure that they are not the same description of goods ; but whether they are or not, it seems to me that they are so uncommonly near the line that we ought not to depart from the view taken by Mr. Justice Kay, and say to the Comptroller, ""You must register in favour of these wine merchants a mark which is already on the Register in favour of a spirit merchant who is also a wine merchant."" It appears to me that Mr. Justice Kay has taken the right view of the case, and that we ought not to interfere with his Order.

And as from January 2005 to May 2007, there is no evidence that Gallo Winery itself exported BAREFOOT wine to Australia or caused it to be sold or offered for sale in Australia. 134 Reliance is placed by Gallo Winery upon both the decision, and the following observations of Windeyer J, in Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis &amp; Goldstein Ltd [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 266 7: ... As a proposition of law it is no doubt perfectly correct that the goods when sold and delivered in London no longer belonged to the manufacturer. But when it is said that a trade mark is used to distinguish the goods of one man from those of another, that abbreviated statement obviously does not refer to the goods of the owner of the mark in the sense of goods which he owns or possesses. After the goods have been sold by him his mark may still, using the definition of trade mark in the Act, be used in relation to those goods for the purpose of indicating a connexion in the course of trade between them and him, the registered proprietor of the mark. The manufacturer who sells goods, marked with his mark, to a warehouseman, wholesaler or retailer does not, in my view, thereupon cease to use the mark in respect of those goods. The mark is his property although the goods are not; and the mark is being used by him so long as the goods are in the course of trade and it is indicative of their origin, that is as his products. Goods remain in the course of trade so long as they are upon a market for sale. Only when they are bought for consumption do they cease to be in the course of trade. ... Reliance is also placed upon the commentary on that decision by the authors of Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off (3 rd ed, 2003). 135 The decision of Windeyer J, it may be noted, was affirmed by Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Taylor and Owen JJ. On appeal their Honours relevantly concluded as follows: By the Act a trade mark means ""a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate, a connexion in the course of trade between the goods and a person who has the right, either as proprietor or as registered user, to use the mark, whether with or without an indication of the identity of that person"" and ""use"" in s. 23 must be understood in this context. Its denotation is not limited by any concept of the physical use of a tangible object and we have no doubt that when an overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country, by means of sales to Australian retail houses, goods bearing his mark and the goods, bearing his mark, are displayed or offered for sale or sold in this country, the use of the mark is that of the manufacturer. Indeed, in this case, the respondent is the only person who has the right to use the mark and the retailer to whom the goods have been sold for re-sale does not, in any relevant sense, use it.: [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 271. Their Honours also went on to conclude: It is conceded that there is a use of the mark in this country by an overseas proprietor where he advertises his mark in this country. Further, it is conceded that there is a use by such a manufacturer of his mark where the property in the goods sold by him by wholesale to traders in this country does not pass until their arrival into Australia. It would, in our view, be an extraordinary result if the maintenance of the Australian trade mark of an overseas manufacturer who is projecting goods of his manufacture on to the Australian market by means of sales to retail houses here can be made to depend upon whether the property in the goods the subject of such sales passes on shipment or upon or after their arrival in Australia.: [1967] HCA 51 ; (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 271 2. See also: Colman W J, Use of a Trade Mark in Australia (1968 1971) 6 Syd LR 52. 136 The commentary on that decision in Shanahan's Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off is as follows: Use through intermediaries [2.175] If a trader uses a sign to distinguish the origin of a product, that sign should continue to do so as the product passes through the hands of others on its way to the ultimate consumer. Each time that the product is ""traded"" there will be, for the purposes of the 1995 Act, a use of the sign by the first trader to distinguish that trader's dealing with the product. The ""ultimate consumer"", submits Gallo Winery, was the Australian purchaser. 140 In Estex Clothing the London manufacturer knew that its goods had been sold into Australia. But Gallo Winery contends that the result in that decision would have been the same even had the manufacturer not known to whom the goods were sold or the market into which they were to be sold. So much, contends Gallo Winery , is supported by the reliance placed by Windeyer J on Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 162 , 4 RPC 45 at 57 9, a decision which Windeyer J observed "" contains much that is instructive "". In a passage commencing at 178, Stirling J observed: The case as to the other five classes of goods rests on different considerations, and raises the question what is meant by the user of a trade-mark in England. Now, in considering that, I do not think I can do better than refer to what Lord Westbury said in McAndrew v. Bassett [4 DJ&amp;S 380] with respect to the essential ingredients of a trade-mark. He says [4 DJ&amp;S 384]: ""An element of the right to the property in a trade-mark may be represented as being the fact of the article being in the market as a vendible article, with that stamp or trade-mark, at the time when the defendants imitate it. The essential ingredients for constituting an infringement of that right probably would be found to be no other than these : first, that the mark has been applied by the plaintiffs properly (that is to say), that they have not copied any other person's mark, and that the mark does not involve any false representation ; secondly, that the article so marked is actually a vendible article in the market ; and, thirdly, that the defendants, knowing that to be so, have imitated the mark for the purpose of passing in the market other articles of a similar description."" It seems to me, according to that passage from Lord Westbury's judgment, that the trade-mark has been used in England if you find that the articles marked with it have been actually vendible articles in the market in England ; and that is the test which I proceed to apply to the various classes of goods which remain. Gallo Winery's contention is that knowledge or intention on the part of the registered proprietor is not determinative; that which matters is whether its goods, to which its trade mark had been applied, were on the market at all. The trade mark, it is contended, is used in Australia if the product to which the mark is applied is on the Australian market. 141 The decision in Estex Clothing , it is considered, does not support such a contention so widely expressed. 142 Rejected in Estex Clothing was the proposition that the fact that property had passed in the goods outside of Australia was sufficient in itself to establish that there had not been a use of the trade mark in Australia. And, as is correctly submitted by Lion Nathan, if the sale by the retail house of the goods bearing the overseas trader's mark was sufficient on its own to constitute use by the overseas trader, there would have been no reason for the Full Court to have gone on to emphasise the acts of the overseas trader in projecting the goods into the Australian market. 143 In the circumstances of the present proceedings, and leaving intention or knowledge aside, there are no objective criteria comparable to those that existed in Estex Clothing such that it can be concluded that the registered proprietor of the trade mark "" projected "" its goods into any market other than Germany. 144 Such authorities as have discussed Estex Clothing have not confronted the factual situation where goods have been exported to one country and thereafter arrived in Australia without the knowledge of the registered owner of the trade mark, or without any agreement or understanding being in place whereby the goods exported were to make their way or may make their way into Australian trade, or without any objective criteria such that it could be concluded that goods had been projected into the Australian market. 145 In Estex Clothing the goods exported were being forwarded from England to Australia, and it is not considered that the language employed by their Honours should be construed as contemplating anything beyond what they literally said. By exporting the goods from England into Australia the "" overseas manufacturer projects into the course of trade in this country ... goods bearing his mark "". Such other authorities also seem to contemplate that there has to be an export of goods from overseas into Australia. Thus, in Brother Industries Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 , 163 FCR 530 , Tamberlin J referred to Estex Clothing and summarised its effect as follows: [42] ... Put another way, where an overseas company has registered a trade mark in Australia for products it exports to the Australian market, then it is that company, when and if it distributes the goods into Australia, which can be said to have ""used"" its trade mark. See also: Asia Television Ltd v Yau's Entertainment Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 838 at [9] , [2000] FCA 838 ; 49 IPR 264 at 268 per Gyles J. 147 Estex Clothing , it is considered, provides no support for a conclusion that the export of wine from the United States into Germany in February 2001 was also the projection in a comparable manner of that wine into the Australian market as it occurred over a year later in July 2002. 148 This conclusion is consistent with the interpretation of Estex Clothing provided by Aickin J in Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. His Honour there referred to Estex Clothing and continued (at 688): It was argued that Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty. Ltd. v. Ellis and Goldstein Ltd. decided that a retailer who sold imported goods bearing an Australian registered trade mark did not use the mark, and that therefore a ""distributor"" did not use a mark which was already on the goods. In my opinion the Estex Case is not authority for that proposition. It is authority for the proposition that the foreign owner of an Australian mark uses it in Australia when he sells goods for delivery abroad to Australian retailers and those retailers import them into Australia for sale and there sell them. It demonstrates that such a situation does not differ from that where he sells the goods for delivery in Australia to the retailer or where he advertises the goods in Australia. ...",Criminal Case,Murder,0.028,0.019,0.954,0.976,6.41

Case1413,Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425,"Reliance is placed by Gallo Winery upon the obiter comments of Falconer J in Hermes Trade Mark [1982] RPC 425. In that decision an application was made for the removal of the trade mark "" Hermes "", in relation to watches, for non-use during a five year period. That application was rejected. Falconer J nevertheless went on to observe that, had it been necessary to exercise the statutory discretion conferred by s 52 of the Trade Marks Act 1938 (UK), his Honour would have allowed the mark to remain on the Register. Relevant to that conclusion were five factors: there had been no abandonment of the trade mark; the registered proprietors still had a residual reputation in the mark; there had been sales by the registered proprietors of watches since the relevant period ended; the applicants for removal had entered the market without having taken steps to ascertain from the Register whether anyone had a right to exclude their use of the mark; and the registered proprietors were not aware of the applicant's sales under the "" Hermes "" mark. 203 That list of considerations is, obviously enough, not an exhaustive catalogue of factors that may be taken into account. But it does provide some assistance. No attempt was made in the present proceedings to establish any reputation or sale of Gallo Winery's wines in Australia under the trade mark BAREFOOT prior to May 2004. No question of any "" residual reputation "" thus arises in the present proceedings by reason of earlier sales in Australia. But there have been sales in Australia since May 2007 of Gallo Winery's wines using the BAREFOOT trade mark and there certainly has been no intention on the part of Gallo Winery to abandon its use of that mark. And Lion Nathan knew that there was a risk that Gallo Winery may have been able to establish a use of its mark during the three year period 2004 2007. 204 As is frequently the case with any exercise of discretion, the considerations relevant to the exercise are seldom all one way.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.023,0.051,0.926,-0.8743,-0.03204999999999991

(iv) are the radler beers of Lion Nathan "" goods of the same description "" as the BAREFOOT wine of Gallo Winery ? (v) is the manner in which Lion Nathan uses its sign "" not likely to deceive or cause confusion ""? (vi) has there been a "" non-use "" of the BAREFOOT trade mark during the period from 7 May 2004 to 8 May 2007? The resolution of this question, as it was advanced in submissions, separately involves a consideration as to: (a) whether there were sales of the BAREFOOT wine during the non-use period; (b) whether the wine was offered for sale during the non-use period; (c) if the wine was sold or offered for sale during the non-use period, whether there was a use of the trade mark by Barefoot Cellars as an authorised user; (d) if the wine was sold or offered for sale during the non-use period, whether there was a use of the trade mark by Beach Avenue Wholesalers as an authorised user; (e) whether the negotiations as between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines during the non-use period constituted a use of the trade mark; (f) whether there was an "" obstacle "" to the use of the Gallo Winery trade mark; (g) even if there was a use, which mark was in fact being used; and (h) whether any use was a use "" in good faith "". (vii) if there has been a "" non-use "" of the trade mark by Gallo Winery , should the discretion conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act be exercised so as to allow its trade mark to remain on the Register? Depending upon the manner in which one or other of these questions may be answered, other questions may not necessarily have to be answered. With the concurrence of the parties, however, the course has been taken of answering each of these questions should the matter proceed further. 24 Section 120(2) dictates that Lion Nathan infringes the trade mark of Gallo Winery if Lion Nathan "" uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery . The term "" sign "" is itself broadly defined by s 6 as including: ... the following or any combination of the following, namely, any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, aspect of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent. 25 The trade mark of Gallo Winery is the word "" BAREFOOT "". 26 In the present proceedings there is a dispute at the outset as to the ability of Lion Nathan to rely upon any sign other than the word "" BAREFOOT "" or the combination of words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". The dispute centres upon whether the Amended Defence so confines Lion Nathan or whether Lion Nathan is otherwise free to contend that its sign also incorporates the image of a bare foot. 31 Lion Nathan contends that as a matter of fact, the "" sign "" which it is using for the purposes of s 120 is a combination of the words and the image -- and further contends that such a finding of fact is not to be denied by the pleadings. Its position is that: (i) its Amended Defence is simply a response to the allegations being made against it and there was no obligation or requirement placed upon it to positively set forth what was the "" sign "" in fact being used by it for the purposes of s 120; and (ii) any unfairness to the Applicant is removed by reason of its written Outline of Opening Submissions , available at the outset of the hearing, which stated that: [46] The Court should find that the trade mark used by the Respondent to distinguish the Respondent's beer from other beers on the market comprises the words BAREFOOT RADLER and an image of a bare foot. ... 32 Notwithstanding paragraph [46] of its Outline of Opening Submissions , it is considered that the Amended Defence confines Lion Nathan to the position that the "" sign "" upon which it places reliance for the purposes of defending the current proceedings is the combination alone of the words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". Albeit in response to the allegation in the Further Amended Statement of Claim that it has infringed Gallo Winery's BAREFOOT trade mark, the Amended Defence states in part that it "" denies that the sign to be used by the Respondent, BAREFOOT RADLER, is substantially identical or deceptively similar to the Applicant's BAREFOOT Trade Mark "". This can only be construed as conveying to the Applicant at least two things: (i) the position that the Respondent denies that the sign to be used is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the Applicant's sign; and (ii) the sign "" to be used "" by the Respondent, and to be relied upon in resisting the Applicant's claim, is the sign it then identifies, namely "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". 33 Had the Amended Defence simply denied the infringement being alleged, Lion Nathan may well have been able to advance submissions that the sign to be used was a combination of the words and the image. But the fact is that the Amended Defence goes on to expressly identify the sign which it says is not substantially identical with or deceptively similar to that being relied upon by Gallo Winery , and it identifies that sign as being "" BAREFOOT RADLER "". At the very least, that express statement in the Amended Defence is productive of such uncertainty that it was thereafter incumbent upon Lion Nathan to identify in its Amended Defence the sign upon which reliance was to be placed -- if that sign was to be anything other than the combination of words. Without that further express clarification, a contention that the "" sign "" is the words and the image would be a contention that would "" take the other party by surprise "" within the meaning of O 11, r 10. 36 But for its pleadings, there was otherwise no reason not to conclude that the "" sign "" Lion Nathan was in fact the following, incorporating both a combination of the words and the image: Such is what appears on the cardboard packaging for its "" six pack ""; such is what appears on the individual bottles of beer and in its advertisements for its beer. And each of the elements of that "" sign "" has a degree of prominence. Prominence is attracted to the image of the bare foot and the word "" BAREFOOT "" by reason of their being printed in white; prominence is also equally attracted to the word "" RADLER "" by reason of it being printed in green. The words and the image of the bare foot are given additional prominence by all being set against a blue background encircled by a roughly drawn white circumference. The word "" BAREFOOT "" is also given additional prominence by that word dissecting the image of the bare foot. 37 Given the constraint imposed by the pleadings, however, there is similarly no reason not to conclude that the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is the combination of the words "" BAREFOOT RADLER "" alone. This was the sign identified in the Amended Defence. Even without the image of the bare foot, the prominence and distinctiveness of those words remains sufficiently discrete as to be the "" sign "" used. 38 What is the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan , it is accepted by both parties, is a question of fact. 39 The second of the questions posed requires resolution of whether the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery. 40 There is no dispute between the parties as to the meaning of the phrase "" substantially identical "" as used in s 120(1) -- the dispute is as to the manner in which that phrase is to be applied to the facts. 41 There is no definition in the 1995 Act of the phrase "" substantially identical "". 44 A "" side by side "" comparison of the trade mark of Gallo Winery and the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan -- as confined by its pleadings -- discloses, it is considered, no substantial identity . The two marks are certainly not "" identical "". The two marks have in common the word "" BAREFOOT "". But the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan also employs the additional word "" RADLER "". The question is thus whether there is a substantial identity. Section 120(2), it will be noted, does not require that the two marks be "" identical ""; s 120(2) is infringed if the mark of Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with "" that of Gallo Winery . 45 In reaching the conclusion that the marks are not substantially identical, it has been recognised that the word "" BAREFOOT "" is both an ordinary English word and a word which has been used in a variety of contexts advertising many different types of goods. An internet search undertaken by a law graduate employed by the solicitors for Lion Nathan (Mr Campbell) disclosed the word "" BAREFOOT "" being used in the promotion of a beach-side resort; a water-skiing club; a sailing cruise; a coffee roaster; weddings; horse saddles; furniture; and vacations. Other instances were also exposed. Not surprisingly, many of these products had some association with the beach or water. 46 It is a word, however, common to both marks and a word which is strongly associated with a carefree lifestyle. 47 But it is the addition of the word "" RADLER "" which denies any substantial identity as between the trade mark of Gallo Winery and the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan . Rejected is a submission advanced by Gallo Winery that the word "" RADLER "" is but a description of a particular type of beer and that it is the word "" BAREFOOT "" alone which distinguishes its beer from that of others. It is the combination of the words which distinguishes the Lion Nathan beer -- an essential and prominent feature of the sign as used by Lion Nathan is thus not only the word "" BAREFOOT"" but also the word "" RADLER "". Lion Nathan's use of the word "" RADLER "" is an important and integral part of the sign it uses and is an obvious source of distinction. 48 Of limited assistance in confirming such a conclusion is the following exchange between the Deputy Chairman of McWilliams Wines (Mr Kevin McLintock) and his cross-examiner: But your reaction at the time when you saw the product was that the name of the product was Barefoot Radler capital B, capital R, wasn't it? --- Correct. ... ... because you think that the name of this product is Barefoot Radler don't you? --- Yes. 49 Had Lion Nathan not been confined by its pleadings and had it been free to also include as part of its sign the image of the bare foot, any finding of fact that there was substantial identity would have been more easily denied. The differences would be such that -- and the total impression would be such that -- any similarity as would have been occasioned by the word "" BAREFOOT "" alone would be of little significance. The similarity, of course, would remain the single word "" BAREFOOT "". But the differences would be even more significant if the prominent image of the bare foot were able to be included. 50 Section 120(1) is expressed in the alternative and requires a consideration of whether the "" sign "" being used by Lion Nathan is "" substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to "" the trade mark of Gallo Winery . 51 Again, there is no dispute between the parties as to the meaning to be given to the phrase "" deceptively similar "" -- the dispute is as to the manner in which that phrase is to be applied to the facts. 52 A trade mark is taken to be "" deceptively similar to "" another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion: s 10. 57 The impression based on a recollection of the "" sign "" as used by Lion Nathan and a recollection of Gallo Winery's trade mark, it is considered, would lead to a likelihood of deception or confusion. 197 In applying the terms of the discretion previously conferred by s 23(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth), Foster J observed that it was a discretion only to be exercised in "" exceptional circumstances "": Jonathan Ross Sceats v Jonathan Sceats Design Pty Ltd (1990) 17 IPR 28. Foster J there observed at 29 30: The section to which I have just made reference has been the subject of consideration by courts of high authority. It is quite clear that the word ""may"", used in the section, requires that a court, in determining whether relief should be granted, exercise a discretion. Accordingly, a court in considering the matters raised by s 23 may, even though it be satisfied that the desiderata of the section have been made out, nevertheless refrain from ordering the removal of the trade mark in the manner contemplated by the section. The question of the operation of this discretion is considered in Shanahan's Australian Trade Mark Law and Practice, 1982 ed, p 212, under the heading, ""Discretion under s 23(1)"". The learned author refers to the decision of Kitto J in Carl Zeiss Pty Ltd's Application [1969] HCA 17 ; (1969) 122 CLR 1 , which clearly establishes the existence of the residual discretion in the court, to which I have made reference. It is also clear, as the learned author points out, that the discretion is one of general application and not restricted specifically to sections of the Act. However, he also goes on to say: ""It has been said that the discretion should be exercised only in 'exceptional circumstances'; however, there may well be cases where the public interest requires that the registration be retained."" Reference is made to the case of J Lyons &amp; Co Ltd's Application [1959] RPC 120 at 130. I consider that the law is quite clear in this regard: although the discretion not to make an order of removal exists even though the enabling circumstances required by the section are proved, the discretion to refuse such an order is only to be exercised in the exceptional circumstances referred to.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.055,0.032,0.913,0.9946,6.4581
Case1420,"Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 , 223 ALR 27","The discretion presently conferred by s 101(3) of the 1995 Act, it has been said, confers a "" broad discretion "": C A Henschke &amp; Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1539 at [72] , [2000] FCA 1539 ; 52 IPR 42 at 73. And it is a discretion, it is considered, no longer constrained by any requirement to establish "" exceptional circumstances ""; it is a discretion which may be exercised "" when it is reasonable to do so "": Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 , 223 ALR 27. Lander J there indicated that he was of the view that it was not reasonable not to remove the mark in issue. Of the discretion, his Honour concluded: [97] ... There are significant differences in the section considered by the Court of Appeal in Lyons [(1959) 76 RPC 120] and s 101(3). In the English section, regard had to be had to the bona fide use of the trade mark during the relevant period. No such regard is had in s 101(3). It is always dangerous to have regard to a statement of principle in relation to the exercise of a discretion in a section in an Act which is not in pari materia with a section of a second Act for the purpose of considering the way in which a discretion should be exercised in that second Act. [98] In Upjohn [(1998) 42 IPR 576] it was said that the power may be applied in ""exceptional circumstances"". Section 101(3) does not say that. There is no warrant to read the expression ""exceptional circumstances"" into the subsection. That would be to give the subsection a construction contrary to its express terms. In my opinion, the discretion which is to be exercised under s 101(3) is to be exercised as the subsection itself says, ""when it is reasonable to do so"". To suggest that the party against whom the non-use has been put in a case such as this should establish exceptional circumstances is to put too high a hurdle in that party's path. 210 Although the "" guiding principle behind the discretion is public interest, particularly in the integrity of the register "" ( Kowa Co Ltd v Organon [2005] FCA 1282 at [92] , [2005] FCA 1282 ; 223 ALR 27 at 41 2 per Lander J), the private commercial interests of both Gallo Winery and Lion Nathan remain matters which may be taken into account when exercising the discretion. Trade mark law, it has been recognised, is more complex than is suggested by the proposition that the supreme -- or, at least -- a predominant interest is the maintenance of the integrity of the Register: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 at [40] , [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 65. Speaking of the 1955 Act, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ there pointed out the balance struck by the legislation between various interests. Both the interests of the consuming public and the interests of traders have to be recognised. Their Honours observed that: [42] ... the Australian legislation has manifested from time to time a varying accommodation of commercial and the consuming public's interests. There is the interest of consumers in recognising a trade mark as a badge of origin of goods or services and in avoiding deception or confusion as to that origin. There is the interest of traders, both in protecting their goodwill through the creation of a statutory species of property protected by the action against infringement, and in turning this property to valuable account by licensing or assignment. The provisions of the 1955 Act with respect to defensive registrations and certification marks were recognitions that the interests of the owners of registered trade marks may go beyond that of indicating trade origin. In Yale Electric Corporation v Robertson [(1928) 26 F 2d 972 at 973], Judge Learned Hand said of this interest: ""that one merchant shall not divert customers from another by representing what he sells as emanating from the second. This has been, and perhaps even more now is, the whole Law and the Prophets on the subject, though it assumes many guises."" In this decade, legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and now in Australia to varying degrees has extended the infringement action to restrain activities which are likely adversely to affect the interests of the owner of a ""famous"" or ""well-known"" trade mark by the ""dilution"" of its distinctive qualities or of its value to the owner.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.095,0.033,0.872,0.9925,6.4117500000000005

Case1422,Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414,"The reference to Moorgate is a reference to Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414. Gummow J referred to that decision as setting forth the "" applicable principles "" and set forth (at IPR 518 19) the following passages from the judgment of Deane J (at CLR 433 4): To establish prior use of the mark in Australia, Moorgate relies upon evidence that, during or in connexion with discussions between Loew's and Philip Morris about the introduction of the low tar and nicotine cigarette in Australia, packets of cigarettes and associated advertising material displaying the name ""KENT GOLDEN LIGHTS"" were handed personally, or in one instance sent by mail, to representatives of Philip Morris in Australia. That evidence indicates that there were at least three occasions on which such cigarette packets and advertising material were so delivered. At the times when those items were so delivered, there was no intention on the part of Loew's that it would itself trade in the goods in Australia. Nor, for that matter, had it been decided what name would be used if Philip Morris were, under licence from Loew's, to commence to manufacture and market the goods in Australia at some indefinite future time. ... In the present case, there was not, at any relevant time, any actual trade or offer to trade in goods bearing the mark in Australia or any existing intention to offer or supply such goods in trade. There was no local use of the mark as a trade mark at all; there were merely preliminary discussions and negotiations about whether the mark would be so used. The cigarette packets and associated advertising material were delivered to Philip Morris to demonstrate what Loew's was marketing in other countries and what Philip Morris might market, under licence from Loew's, if it decided to manufacture and trade in the goods in Australia and to use the mark locally at some future time. There was no relevant trade in the goods in Australia and the delivery of the cigarette packets and associated material to Philip Morris did not, in the circumstances, constitute a relevant user or use in Australia of the mark ""KENT GOLDEN LIGHTS"" for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connexion in the course of trade between the new cigarettes and Loew's. 169 Moorgate Tobacco is not authority for the proposition that an intention alone to use a trade mark constitutes a use sufficient to defeat an application for removal for non-use. 170 Gallo Winery further contends that, in the event that there was a non-use of the trade mark, there was an "" obstacle "" to its use. This obstacle was the fact that Logan Wines Pty Ltd ( Logan Wines ) had a registered trade mark which it considered was remarkably similar to the BAREFOOT design which Gallo Winery had acquired from Barefoot Cellars . 171 The trade mark of Logan Wines had been registered in April 2004 and was as follows: The trade mark of Gallo Winery was of course the word BAREFOOT , but not the image of the bare foot as depicted in the mark of Logan Wines .",Criminal Case,Murder,0.0,0.029,0.971,-0.8265,0.13624999999999998

Centrally relevant to that discretion must remain a consideration of whether the public would be deceived or confused. Considerations such as those deposed to by Mr Simpson, and in particular the costs incurred in promoting a product, however, assume some limited relevance and assist the conclusion -- otherwise reached -- that the discretion should be exercised adversely to Gallo Winery .

Case1428,Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670,"The use of a trade mark is an authorised use only to the extent that the user uses the trade mark "" under the control of the owner of the trade mark "": s 8(2). The essential requirement is that there must be a connection in the course of trade with the registered proprietor: Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. Aickin J there observed (at 683): These cases demonstrate that the essential requirement for the maintenance of the validity of a trade mark is that it must indicate a connexion in the course of trade with the registered proprietor, even though the connexion may be slight, such as selection or quality control or control of the user in the sense in which a parent company controls a subsidiary. Use by either the registered proprietor or a licensee (whether registered or otherwise) will protect the mark from attack on the ground of non-user, but it is essential both that the user maintains the connexion of the registered proprietor with the goods and that the use of the mark does not become otherwise deceptive. Conversely registration of a registered user will not save the mark if there ceases to be the relevant connexion in the course of trade with the proprietor or the mark otherwise becomes deceptive. 148 This conclusion is consistent with the interpretation of Estex Clothing provided by Aickin J in Pioneer Kabushiki Kaisha v Registrar of Trade Marks [1977] HCA 56 ; (1977) 137 CLR 670. His Honour there referred to Estex Clothing and continued (at 688): It was argued that Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty. Ltd. v. Ellis and Goldstein Ltd. decided that a retailer who sold imported goods bearing an Australian registered trade mark did not use the mark, and that therefore a ""distributor"" did not use a mark which was already on the goods. In my opinion the Estex Case is not authority for that proposition. It is authority for the proposition that the foreign owner of an Australian mark uses it in Australia when he sells goods for delivery abroad to Australian retailers and those retailers import them into Australia for sale and there sell them. It demonstrates that such a situation does not differ from that where he sells the goods for delivery in Australia to the retailer or where he advertises the goods in Australia. ...",Criminal Case,Murder,0.02,0.024,0.956,-0.1962,2.3173

See also: de Cordova v Vick Chemical Co (1951) 68 RPC 103. 61 A distinction may be drawn as between the present case and that in Polo Textile -- but that distinction does not lead to any different conclusion. Unlike the use of a bland word such as "" Club "" -- as in the Polo Textile decision -- the word "" RADLER "" adds an additional and important distinguishing feature to the product.

In allowing an appeal from a decision refusing to register a trade mark, Wilcox J concluded (at 624): The questions whether one mark is deceptively similar to another and whether the first mark is used in respect of services closely related to particular goods (or similar to other particular services) are conceptually distinct. However, the first question cannot be addressed in isolation from the second. The closer the relationship between the services and particular goods, the more likely any similarity in marks will prove deceptive. The examples offered by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire make the point. There are extremely close associations between the sale of data processing equipment and the provision of programs for its operation, the sale and sewing of curtains and the sale and tailoring of clothes. Because the relevant service is so specialised, and focused on the particular goods, it would be natural for any member of the public to treat a similarity of name as being an indication of a link between the origin of the goods and that of the service. At the other extreme, the use of even the same name, by traders in different industries, would not usually cause members of the public to assume a link between the traders.

Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Taylor JJ there, at 606 7, gave content to the task to be undertaken as follows: The fact that examination of the nature of the applicant's goods may, by itself, induce an observer to conclude that they are different in character from those of an opponent, and designed to serve different purposes, is by no means conclusive. Nor is the fact that the applicant's goods are not specified by the regulations as being within the same class of goods... There may be many matters to be considered apart from the inherent character of the goods in respect of which the application is made and some indication of what matters are relevant to this inquiry was given by Romer J. in In re Jellinek's Application [(1946) 63 RPC 59]. Romer J. thought it necessary to look beyond the nature of the goods in question and to compare not only their respective uses but also to examine the trade channels through which the commodities in question were bought and sold. Shortly after the decision in Jellinek's Case the Assistant-Comptroller elaborated on the observations of Romer J. in the following manner: ""In arriving at a decision upon this issue the reported cases show that I have to take account of a number of factors, including in particular the nature and characteristics of the goods, their origin, their purpose, whether they are usually produced by one and the same manufacturer or distributed by the same wholesale houses, whether they are sold in the same shops over the same counters during the same seasons and to the same class or classes of customers, and whether by those engaged in their manufacture and distribution they are regarded as belonging to the same trade. In the case of Jellinek's Application [(1946) 63 RPC 59] , Romer J. classified these various factors under three heads, viz., the nature of the goods, the uses thereof, and the trade channels through which they are bought and sold. No single consideration is conclusive in itself, and it has further been emphasized that the classifications contained in the schedules to the Trade Marks Rules are not a decisive criterion as to whether or not two sets of goods are 'of the same description'"": In re an Application by John Crowther &amp; Sons (Milnsbridge) Ltd. [(1948) 65 RPC 369 at 372]. Much the same considerations are evident in the observation of Dixon J. (as he then was) in Reckitt &amp; Colman (Australia) Ltd. v. Boden [1945] HCA 12 ; [(1945) 70 CLR 84 at 94] when he said: ""What forms the same description of goods must be discovered from a consideration of the course of trade or business. One factor is the use to which the two sets of goods are put. Another is whether they are commonly dealt with in the same course of trade or business.

Case1440,"Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 , 107 FCR 166","To fall within s 100(3)(c) it is not sufficient for the owner of a trade mark to point to circumstances peculiar to himself. There must be some circumstance which in a practical business sense caused the non-use of the mark: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 , 107 FCR 166. Drummond J there summarised the approach to be adopted as follows: [46] It can be accepted that the wording of s 100(3)(c) was deliberately adopted to give the subsection a wider operation than the narrowly worded provision contained in s 23(4) of the 1955 Act. It is now not necessary to show unusual or abnormal, as opposed to normal or usual, trading conditions (a difficult concept to comprehend and apply) before s 100(3)(c) can operate. Ordinary incidents of the trade cycle commonly encountered by traders, as well as abnormal ones, are now within the provision. Further, it is clear that a circumstance of a trading nature that has an impact only on the registered owner can also now be relied on to justify non-use of the mark. [47] In the context of s 100(3)(c), there are, however, good grounds for reading ""circumstances"" as not embracing any event of any kind. The circumstances must be ""an obstacle to the use of the trade mark by the registered owner"". This suggests that they must arise from or comprise events external to the registered owner in the sense of not having been brought about by the voluntary act of the owner. [48] But if any circumstance external to the owner, in the sense of being a circumstance not brought about by the voluntary act of the owner, is within the provision, the Court would be drawn into inquiries of a kind that it is difficult to accept were in the contemplation of the Parliament. Financial impecuniosity could excuse non-use of a trade mark, irrespective of how enduring and intractable the owner's impecuniosity might be. Illness of the registered owner could also excuse non-use of the registered trade mark (as is the contention of the applicants here). A falling out between joint registered owners of a mark that disrupts the use by either of the mark might also be capable of excusing non-use. In all such situations, questions could arise requiring investigation by the Court into whether the obstructing circumstances were due to the conduct of the registered owner. [49] If the Parliament intended any circumstance external to the owner to be capable of providing an excuse for non-use, little purpose would be served by the words in parenthesis in s 100(3)(c), namely, ""whether affecting traders generally or only the registered owner of the trade mark"". The presence of these words is some indication that the circumstances comprising an obstacle to use of the mark must not only arise externally to the registered owner, but must also be circumstances of a trading nature. His Honour considered that s 100(3)(c) was "" sufficiently obscure "" to occasion recourse to extrinsic material, including the Second Reading Speech . His Honour continued: [54] It is apparent from these extrinsic materials that s 100(3)(c) was not intended by the Parliament to provide a defence to an attack on a registered trade mark for non-use on any grounds, including grounds entirely personal to the trade mark owner that do not bear any trading character, so long only as they do not arise from the voluntary actions of the owner. [55] In my opinion, circumstances within s 100(3)(c) will only exist when events arise that are capable of disrupting trade in the area of commercial activity in which goods bearing the registered owner's mark are traded. For the statutory excuse to be made out, those circumstances must cause (in a practical business sense) non-use of the particular mark by the owner, whether or not they have an impact on any persons other than the owner of that mark who are also involved in that same area of commercial activity. There must be a causal link shown between the relevant circumstances and the mark's non-use. This requirement arises from the fact that s 100(3)(c) creates an excuse only where the mark has not been used by the registered owner ""because of"" circumstances etc. It will not assist the opponent to removal to show the existence of an impediment to use of the kind referred to in s 100(3)(c) if he does not also establish that, but for that impediment, he would have used the mark. Compare Re James Crean &amp; Son Ltd's Trade Mark [(1921) 38 RPC 155] at 162. [56] Circumstances that do not have a trade character but which only affect a mark owner in his personal character, such as illness afflicting the owner of the mark that is sufficiently disabling to prevent the owner using the mark, can never therefore found an answer within s 100(3)(c) to an application for removal of the mark for non-use. 167 In the present proceedings there were undoubtedly discussions between Gallo Winery and McWilliams Wines as to the launch in Australia of BAREFOOT wine. But by May 2007 the negotiations had not proceeded beyond just that, negotiations. Compare: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [40] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 179. There was unquestionably an intention to launch BAREFOOT wine in Australia "" in around September 2007 "". But, and unlike the position in Buying Systems , there had been no step taken during the non-use period comparable to the placing of advertisements or the printing of letterheads or business cards. The only step which had been taken was the unilateral step taken by McWilliams Wines to allocate some of its wine. Gallo Winery was pleased that such a step had been taken as it preserved the possibility of a launch in September 2007. That was a step taken, however, by McWilliams Wines and not by Gallo Winery. 168 Gallo Winery , it is considered, had only engaged in preliminary or preparatory acts: Woolly Bull Enterprises Pty Ltd v Reynolds [2001] FCA 261 at [28] , [2001] FCA 261 ; 107 FCR 166 at 175 per Drummond J.

It requires a "" substantial and genuine "" use: NSW Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co Ltd (No 1) (1989) 14 IPR 26 at 45. Gummow J concluded: In these circumstances, it is clear that in the three year period ending 6 June 1988 (being the period specified in s 23(1)(b)) the moo mark had been used by the registered proprietor not only in relation to cheese, but also in relation to flavoured milk in the sense required to preserve the registration, subject only to the further requirement that the use answered the description of having been bona fide. In ""Concord"" Trade Mark [1987] FSR 209 ; Falconer J held that to be bona fide within the meaning of the equivalent provision in the British legislation (s 26 of the 1938 Act) use should be substantial and genuine judged by ordinary commercial standards considered in relation to the trade concerned. ... I should add that use by the first respondent would not cease to be bona fide even if the evidence had been that it used the trade mark only after it appreciated that the registration was vulnerable to an attack on the ground of non-use by reason of the lack of activity of the second respondent; nor would it cease to be bona fide, even though, as is the case on the evidence, neither the officers of the first respondent nor its patent attorney, who dealt with the second respondent at the time the assignment was taken in 1987, had enquired closely of the second respondent as to the extent of its previous user of the trade mark...

Case1441,Woolworths Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 42 IPR 615,"In support of the submission that reliance may be placed upon not only the sign being used by Lion Nathan but also upon a wider ranger of considerations, including the manner in which that sign is being used and the differences between the competing products, reference was made to Woolworths Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 42 IPR 615. In allowing an appeal from a decision refusing to register a trade mark, Wilcox J concluded (at 624): The questions whether one mark is deceptively similar to another and whether the first mark is used in respect of services closely related to particular goods (or similar to other particular services) are conceptually distinct. However, the first question cannot be addressed in isolation from the second. The closer the relationship between the services and particular goods, the more likely any similarity in marks will prove deceptive. The examples offered by Lockhart J in Caterpillar Loader Hire make the point. There are extremely close associations between the sale of data processing equipment and the provision of programs for its operation, the sale and sewing of curtains and the sale and tailoring of clothes. Because the relevant service is so specialised, and focused on the particular goods, it would be natural for any member of the public to treat a similarity of name as being an indication of a link between the origin of the goods and that of the service. At the other extreme, the use of even the same name, by traders in different industries, would not usually cause members of the public to assume a link between the traders. On appeal, the decision of Wilcox J was upheld: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCA 1020 , 93 FCR 365.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.054,0.023,0.923,0.8589,5.97515

Case1443,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225,"general nature of the conduct which is alleged by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Authority) to constitute contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act), together with pertinent principles in relation to the imposition of penalty are canvassed at some length in reasons for judgment which I delivered on 23 October 2009 in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)). These reasons for the judgment should also then, in respect of those two subjects, be read in conjunction with that earlier (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)) judgment in this matter. Some repetition is necessary as to the general background, if only to provide a context against which the particular involvement of Jobspy and Mr Moles falls for assessment of penalty. The essence of the contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act , which are established by the default judgment, is a contravention, and a repeated contravention, by the sending of unsolicited short message service (SMS) messages to the mobile telephones of users who have been deceived, inveigled even, into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (Mobilegate), or, as the case may be, Winning Bid Pty Ltd (Winning Bid), under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and form relationships via dating websites. It was the very essence of the businesses of Mobilegate and Winning Bid to engage in this conduct. That conduct is a form of seduction for reward of those who are vulnerable. It is a particularly vile form of conduct. Moreover, it is a form of conduct which, when the deception is appreciated by its victim, wounds in a peculiarly embarrassing and emotional way, quite aside from its financial impact. Those non-financial aspects of victim impact are such that the perpetrator of the contravention is to some extent rendered immune, or at least afforded a degree of immunity, from a likelihood of complaint, in my opinion. That is a feature, in my opinion, which is not unknown in respect of criminal activity, and I interpolate at once this is not criminal activity, but contraventions of civil penalties, which touches upon a person's sexual nature. In other words, an embarrassment attends the victim of the contravention and that embarrassment in turn provides the degree of immunity from complaint. I regard that as an aggravating aspect of the contravening conduct.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.1,0.847,-0.9557,-0.29594999999999994
Case1444,Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377,"factor which I took into account in the ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4) judgment is that articulated by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1) at para 43. By reference to other authorities, his Honour observed that, while he accepted that the issue of capacity to pay is a relevant factor, it is one ""of less importance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence"". Deterrence is a factor of particular importance in this case. I have already adverted to the need for penalties to demonstrate that both in the specific and general senses. Whilst the Act does provide for large penalties, it nonetheless makes provision for a daily maximum, something of a cap in other words. Nicholson J drew attention to this feature of the legislation in Clarity 1 by reference to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which became the Spam Act . It is there stated: A daily ceiling for penalties has been set and may be charged for all contraventions against a particular provision that have occurred in one day. This has been included to ensure that a meaningful penalty may be charged for a single contravention without causing an unrealistically large penalty payable for multiple contraventions. For example, there are reported cases of dedicated spammers sending millions of unsolicited commercial and electronic messages each day. Without a ceiling amount for daily contraventions such a spammer could potentially be liable for a million contraventions. Jobspy and its director, Mr Moles, were involved in contravening conduct the subject of default judgment for a period in excess of 800 days. Using the maximum penalties under the Spam Act as a guide for calculation that yields, in the case of Mr Moles, a total potential penalty of over $35 million, and in the case of Jobspy over $100 million.",Criminal Case,Kidnapping,0.078,0.082,0.839,-0.1459,2.49035

Case1451,WG &amp; B Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Tesla Farad Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1776,"It is convenient to deal first with Apache's jurisdictional objection. It is not in dispute that, in the absence of the claims which are founded on the TPA, Newcrest could not pursue a case based on allegations of breach of contract in this Court. Nor is it in dispute that the Court will lack jurisdiction to deal with a controversy in circumstances in which the only federal claims relied are either colourable (in the sense of not being bona fide but rather relied on solely to attract the Court's jurisdiction) or trivial or insubstantial. In WG &amp; B Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Tesla Farad Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1776 Finkelstein J stated the relevant principles (at [11] to [14]) as follows: ""[11] This then requires me to determine whether the non-federal claims are justiciable in the Federal Court. The relevant cases show that if a federal claim which is said to enliven the accrued jurisdiction of the court to dispose of non-federal claims is trivial or unsubstantial, that will not be sufficient to attract that jurisdiction. The cases are collected in the judgment of Merkel J in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 165. As Merkel J pointed out, triviality in this context does not require an examination as to whether the federal claim is less likely to succeed than the non-federal claim. Accrued jurisdiction does not depend upon an assessment being made of the strengths of the federal claim; rather the question is whether the federal claim is genuine. If the federal claim is colourable in the sense that it was made for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, of course the jurisdiction of the court is not enlivened: see Fitzroy Motors Pty Ltd v Hyundai Automotive Distributors Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 445. How is the genuineness of the claim to be determined? One way is to ask whether the federal claim is bound to fail, that is to say, to ask whether the claim is unarguable. If the federal claim is hopeless then it is difficult to see how an applicant could contend that it was pursuing the claim bona fide. [12] However, it is not only when a federal claim is colourable that the Federal Court would lack jurisdiction to deal with non-federal matters. In Fencott v Muller (at 609-610) in a joint judgment of Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ, the following was said: ""However, federal judicial power is attracted to the whole of a controversy only if the federal claim is a substantial aspect of that controversy. A federal claim which is a trivial or insubstantial aspect of the controversy must, of course, itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction, but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to translate to federal jurisdiction the determination of the substantial aspects of the controversy from the jurisdiction to which they are subject in order to determine the trivial or insubstantial federal aspect. Again, impression and practical judgment must determine whether it is appropriate and convenient that the whole controversy be determined by the exercise of federal judicial power."" [13] In the present case, on balance I am not prepared to conclude that the asserted federal claims are not genuine in the sense that they are colourable and only brought for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, but what does seem plain to me is that the cause of action under s52 of the Trade Practices Act is ""trivial or insubstantial"" in the sense explained by the High Court in Fencott v Muller. This is not a claim that would be appropriately and conveniently determined in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. [14] In the result two things follow. First, the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the non-federal claims. Second, there being no other claims that are relied upon to found jurisdiction in the Federal Court, the proceeding must be dismissed with costs."" 19 Newcrest alleges that the respondents expressed opinions and made forecasts without having reasonable grounds to do so. It relies on ss 51A and 52 of the TPA. The particular opinions and forecasts are said to be found in the following documents: &#8226; The late June 2008 press release; &#8226; The 30 July 2008 letter from Apache; and &#8226; The 2 August 2008 letter from Santos. 20 It is said that those documents contain representations that, by mid-August, the respondents would be supplying Newcrest with its full gas entitlement under the contract. Newcrest says that, acting on these representations, it cancelled some temporary arrangements and then was forced to make further alternative arrangements when, in mid-August, full supply had not been restored.

Accordingly, leave to appeal is required by s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

That case applied a two-limbed test to determine when leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision should be granted. First, the decision below must be attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by this Court; secondly, substantial injustice must be demonstrated if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong: at 398. 5 The principal submission made on behalf of the first respondent was that the applicant has not satisfied the first of these requirements. That is, the first respondent submitted that the Federal Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt as to warrant its reconsideration by this Court. 6 It is convenient to note the origins of this proceeding. The applicant filed an application in the High Court for an order nisi on 21 April 2003, which was remitted to the Federal Court by Heydon J on 25 August 2003.

Case1459,Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The second ground relied upon by the applicant is that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in applying s 91R(1)(a) of the Act. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal found that the essential and significant motivation for the harm feared by the applicant was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets. According to the applicant, the Tribunal arrived at this conclusion erroneously by considering the 'primary motivating factor' in the actions taken by the criminals. In substance, the applicant's argument is that the expression 'primary motivating factor' departed from the language of the Act and led the Tribunal to address the wrong question, giving rise to a jurisdictional error: cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. 24 The Tribunal's reasons for decision ought not to be read in an over-technical or pedantic way. They must be read fairly and in context. The expression 'primary motivating factor' was used by the Tribunal on one occasion. Elsewhere in its reasons, both before and afterwards, the Tribunal used the phrase 'the essential and significant reason' or 'the essential and significant motivation'. These expressions correctly reflect the test that is required in relation to s 91R(1)(a). I agree with the submission made on behalf of the first respondent that when the various passages in the Tribunal's reasons are considered together and in context, it becomes clear that the Tribunal applied the correct test. In my opinion, there was no error in the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant's evidence concerning what happened to his family strongly suggest that the essential and significant reason for these events was that criminals wanted to take control of his family's assets. 25 This conclusion was reached by Scarlett FM and I agree with his Honour's reasons.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.118,0.085,0.797,0.5511,4.895849999999999

As to the specific matters relevant in the present case, the parties have made submissions on: the nature and extent of the contravening conduct; the amount of loss or damage caused; the circumstances in which the conduct took place; similar conduct in the past whether the contravener has previously been found by the Court to have engaged in similar conduct; the size of the contravening company; the degree of power the contravening company has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; whether the contravention arose out of conduct of senior management or at a lower level; whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Code, as evidenced by compliance programs and corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Code in relation to the contravention; the financial position of the respondents; the deterrent effect of the proposed penalty; and totality and parity.

The imposition of a financial penalty is a matter for the Court, whether or not the parties propose an agreed figure ( Mobil Oil ). I am aware that the AKA can pay the proposed penalty of $10,000 without going out of business or seriously impeding its activities. I am also aware of the strictures as enunciated in the cases of not substituting an amount by way of penalties simply because another sum comes to mind. I am mindful of the fact that the AKA has agreed to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount to be agreed. I am conscious of the fact that this is a voluntary organisation conducting kart racing in the interests of an interested section of the public. I have taken into account the various factors elucidated in Mobil Oil regarding the public interest in the settlement of litigation. Further, I take into account the following: I am satisfied that the agreed amount of $10,000 is within the permissible range in the present circumstances. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the orders as proposed by consent.

The AKA shall within three months of the date of this order, cause to be sent to each member of the AKA a letter substantially in the form of Attachment 1. The AKA to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs of the proceedings in an amount as agreed between the parties. ATTACHMENT 1 Letter to AKA members [To be placed on the AKA letterhead] [Date] Dear Sir/Madam Anti-competitive arrangement by the AKA Following civil proceedings instituted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (""ACCC""), the Federal Court of Australia has found that the Australian Karting Association (NSW) Incorporated (""the AKA"") and three AKA members made an anti-competitive arrangement at the annual general meeting of the AKA which was held on 19 July 2008. The Court has declared that the AKA engaged in anti-competitive conduct (contravening the Competition Code of New South Wales (""the Competition Code"")) by making an arrangement: to fix the minimum price for the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs (which is said to substantially lessen competition); and to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to non-AKA members by imposing a condition that the non-AKA members pay at least the minimum price (which is an exclusionary provision); and later giving effect to the above arrangement. The Competition Code has the same provisions as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), but applies to individuals and non-trading associations such as AKA clubs. One of the Court's orders is that the AKA must write to each member to notify them of the outcome of these proceedings and to inform them of the illegality of making and giving effect to arrangements which substantially lessen competition or contain an exclusionary provision. The AKA has been ordered to pay a penalty of $10,000 and to pay a contribution to the ACCC's costs. The Court has also granted injunctions restraining the AKA from making arrangements of this kind in the future and has ordered that the AKA establish a trade practices compliance program. If as an AKA member you: agree with other AKA members to a minimum or set price for the hire of kart circuits; agree with other AKA members to prevent, restrict or limit the hire of kart circuits by AKA clubs to a particular class of persons on particular conditions; or give effect to an agreement set out above, you may be in breach of the Competition Code and may be liable to pay fines of up to $10,000,000 for a company or $500,000 for an individual, as well as damages for any loss that is caused.

The parties in the joint submissions referred to further relevant factors addressed by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 at 52,152-52,153 and expanded upon in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2000] FCA 365 ; (2000) 172 ALR 532. It is uncontroversial as between the parties that the total penalty for related offences ought not to exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct involved ( Mornington Inn v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at [42] - [45] , [91] per Stone and Buchanan JJ). The parties also recognise that a principal object of a penalty under s 76 is deterrence ( NW Frozen Foods ). As elaborated, the concept of deterrence is to deter repetition by the contravener and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act ( TPC v CSR at 52,125 per French J), or to deter others who might be tempted to think that contravention would be of benefit and detection would lead merely to a compliance program for the future ( NW Frozen Foods at 294 295 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ). The need to achieve general deterrence as well as specific deterrence means that a party's capacity to pay must be weighed against the need to impose a sum which members of the public will recognise as significant and proportionate to the seriousness of the contravention ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301 at [39] per Goldberg J). Bearing in mind the process as set out by the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 for the assessment of criminal sanctions where penalties are not fixed by statute, the ACCC and the AKA jointly submit that a total pecuniary penalty of $10,000 imposed on the AKA is appropriate and within the range of penalties that a Court would order in these circumstances. The parties point out that in considering the proposed agreed penalty, the Court should take into account the fact that a negotiated resolution may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market. The imposition of penalty is a matter for the Court ( NW Frozen Foods at 290) and the assessment of the appropriate penalty involves exercising a discretion taking into account all relevant factors ( Markarian at [27]). However, the parties submit that the Court should not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure except in a clear case ( NW Frozen Foods at 291, approved and explained in Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; (2004) ATPR 41-993).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.067,0.059,0.873,0.1352,3.4621999999999993

Case1479,"Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804","28 November 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment on liability issues in this proceeding. In that judgment the Court found that the respondent Union contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (""the Act""). This judgment deals with the question of the penalty, if any, which should be imposed on the Union for that contravention. These reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in the substantive matter ( Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804). The Union engaged in unlawful industrial action under the Act by the imposition by its organisers of limited and short lived bans on the performance of work at a building site called the University Hill site. The relevant portion of the judgment in the substantive matter is set out at [16] to [25]. The following points from that part of the substantive judgment are of particular current relevance: (a) 20 October 2005 a ban was placed on work at the site because of the lack of a female toilet whilst a female worker was present and the absence of a site contamination report; after 9.30 am no work was performed on the site, other than by two employees of the head contractor; there were only two sub-contractors working on site immediately before the imposition of the ban: (i) Crushtec Australia Pty Ltd &#8212; who had Ms Sally Belcher performing work on site; and (ii) V&amp;G Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd who had Mr Fred Gilliland and Mr Shannon Gilliland performing work on the site.

Case1481,"Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426","about six months of the relevant events, the Union organised a seminar designed to educate its officials about the effects of the Act. This conduct indicates a desire to avoid repetition of conduct in breach of the Act; see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [53] per Tracey J. There is similar previous conduct, most relevantly in Stuart-Mahoney . The events of which occurred about a fortnight before the current events, although that case is not a prior contravention it shows that similar conduct had been undertaken in the past. I say ""similar"" in a rather loose sense because the imposition of the overtime ban in that matter was far more serious and had far more widespread effects than the transient bans in this matter. Deterrence is important, both general and specific. That is why, notwithstanding the conduct of the head contractor which led to the short lived bans of little consequence, there should be some monetary penalty imposed to reflect that a statutory provision has been breached. It is not as if there was no alternative but to impose a ban. Focussed talks with the head contractor at a high level and/or a referral of the issue to the Commission and/or Worksafe inspectors were alternative available courses of action. In Stuart-Mahoney , Tracey J imposed a penalty of $20,000 for breach of s 38 of the Act in respect of events occurring about the same time as the instant events. Even taking into account the application of the totality principle in that case, the significance and seriousness of the current breach are far less than the circumstances considered by Tracey J. Accordingly, I consider a fine of $5,500 to be appropriate in the current circumstances.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.051,0.083,0.866,-0.8456,0.07239999999999958
Case1482,Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2005] FCA 424,"There was no serious dispute that the first respondent, who had been convicted of theft, breached his duties as a trustee. Thus, the declarations were not controversial. Rather, at the first hearing of this matter on 20 September 2004, the key question was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond or only for compensable loss: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2005] FCA 424 ( Bradshaw 1) at [10] and following. 3 At the first hearing, the Commonwealth did not attempt to prove any costs incurred in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the first respondent. Rather, the Commonwealth pursued its claim that it was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond regardless of the amount of loss. I rejected this contention and held that the Commonwealth was entitled to recover only that which was proven to be its compensable loss: see Bradshaw 1 at [79]. 4 I also stated that I would not dismiss the application before giving the applicants an opportunity to adduce further evidence as to the quantum of the Commonwealth's loss: see Bradshaw 1 at [80].

Case1484,Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 1076,"The applicants submitted that the respondents should pay their costs on a party and party basis up to and including 15 April 2005 (the date I delivered reasons for judgment in Bradshaw 1 ). They conceded that they must bear the respondents' costs thereafter, although only on a party and party basis. There was, they said, nothing in their conduct of the case that warranted a departure from the usual course, because their reliance on Re Smith; ex parte Inspector-General in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 1076 ("" Re Smith "") was not unreasonable and, in respect of the application to reopen, the Court had itself considered, as at 15 April 2005, that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss. 8 The applicants contended that, even though no monetary order was made in their favour, they were partially successful in the proceeding. They noted that: (1) the respondents had not admitted that the first respondent breached the bond; (2) the first respondent argued unsuccessfully that the applicants' claim was statute-barred; and (3) the second respondent argued unsuccessfully that it had revoked its surety. The applicants observed that they had in fact established liability under the bond and as surety, although the applicants properly conceded that arguments (2) and (3) ""did not occupy a great deal of the court's time"". 9 The respondents contended that the making of the declarations was never controversial and that the real question in dispute was whether ""the bond was, in effect, a good behaviour bond, forfeitable without proof of loss"". They sought their costs on a party and party basis until 15 April 2005, after which they sought costs on an indemnity basis. They argued that costs incurred after 15 April 2005 were incurred unnecessarily because evidence quantifying loss could have been led at an earlier stage. They contended that they would not have incurred any costs subsequent to 15 April 2005 had the application to reopen not been made. In written submissions, the second respondent said that ""[t]he 'special or unusual' circumstances warranting an order for indemnity costs are the loss of time to the parties and the Court by the Applicants taking the approach that they did"". 15 I am of the view that the justice of the case warrants an award of indemnity costs in the respondents' favour for the period after 15 April 2005. The decision in Re Smith may explain the applicants' conduct at the first hearing but it does not explain their conduct thereafter. Further, whilst it is true to say that, as at 15 April 2005, the court itself considered that the applicants should be given an opportunity to quantify their loss, the court formed the contrary view when it was informed of the circumstances known to both parties and relevant to the issue. 16 As already stated in Bradshaw 2 at [23], these circumstances showed that the applicants should be taken to have opened and closed their case at the first hearing on the basis that they would not quantify their loss. Although there were factors militating in favour of a grant of leave to reopen, they were outweighed by contrary considerations. These considerations included that: (1) the applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth's loss at the first hearing; (2) prior to the first hearing, the applicants had plainly led the respondents to believe that the applicants were proceeding on the basis that quantum was irrelevant and, in any case, that the loss could not be quantified; (3) the applicants did not make any application for a split trial, although it was open to them to do so; (4) before the first hearing, the applicants knew that it would be said against them that they could not succeed without evidence quantifying their loss; and (5) whilst there were no pleadings, the issue in debate was clearly addressed in the correspondence between the parties prior to the first hearing. These considerations are also relevant to the respondents' application for indemnity costs. 17 Had had the applicants so chosen, they might have led evidence as to quantification at the first hearing. Had they done so, they could have argued that the Commonwealth was entitled to the amount of the bond but they could also have sought to quantify their loss in the event that the court preferred the respondents' submission on the point to theirs. Had the applicants done this, then there would have been no occasion for any subsequent hearings. The applicants took the stance, however, that the quantum of the loss was irrelevant and the loss could not be quantified. In my view, the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing. The costs incurred by the respondents after 15 April 2005, when Bradshaw 1 was delivered, should be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis. I reiterate that although, as at that date, I was minded to give the applicants a further opportunity to quantify their loss, I formed a clear contrary view once I was informed of the circumstances known to both parties, though not the court, as at that date.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.082,0.065,0.852,0.9519,6.31165
Case1485,Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All E R 333,"The first respondent made an alternative claim for indemnity costs for the period following 28 June 2005. On that day, the applicants rejected a settlement offer, made by letter of 21 June 2005, for $23,248 ""in full and final settlement of all the Applicants' claims in this matter (exclusive of costs), being the total sum of all disbursements you have claimed"". Referring to Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All E R 333, the first respondent submitted that he should receive costs on an indemnity basis after that date. 18 As the first respondent noted, costs may also be awarded on an indemnity basis where a proceeding is unduly prolonged by an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233 per Sheppard J. The rejection of a Calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order of indemnity costs, even if the offeree fails to secure a more favourable outcome in the proceedings. In order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents must show that the applicants' rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, e.g., Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J. In this case, the applicants acted unreasonably in seeking to resile from the position that they had adopted in communications with the respondents prior to and at the first hearing. In my view, the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because, as at 28 June 2005 (after the directions hearing of 8 June 2005), the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth's loss unless granted leave to reopen their case, and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming. This alternative basis would also support an award of indemnity costs in the first respondent's favour in respect of the period after 28 June 2005.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.068,0.863,0.1091,3.3808499999999997

Case1500,WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 77 ALD 1,"The Federal Magistrate considered moreover that the issue arising in WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 77 ALD 1 (Lee, Hill and Carr JJ) was distinguishable, as the Tribunal did not make here a positive finding of fraud but rather accorded the letter no weight. 12 In relation to grounds of review raised by the appellant below regarding the obligation of the Minister under s 424A(1) of the Act , the Federal Magistrate found no error to have been established. The country information and the Tribunal's comments on the implausibility of the letter transmitted by fax on 29 November 2003 from a Mr Baksi were excepted from any operation adversely to the Minister of s 424A(3) of the Act . Furthermore her Honour considered that the letter did not constitute a matter upon which the Tribunal relied upon as constituting the inconsistencies between the information provided to the delegate and that to the Tribunal, and further took the view moreover that the Tribunal's thought processes were not information falling within the scope of operation of s 424A(1) of the Act in any event. 13 The Federal Magistrate found in addition that there was no evidence to support the appellant's other grounds for review sought to be advanced in his submissions to the Court, and that the purported grounds for review sought by the appellant were in the nature of merits review of the Tribunal's decision. In the result, her Honour found no reviewable error was established and dismissed the application for review. 14 On 26 May 2006 the appellant filed a notice of appeal, which purported to challenge the Federal Magistrate's decision on a number of grounds. The notice of appeal included the following grounds: the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations and evidence; the Tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to country information; the Tribunal failed to investigate the provenance of the letter from the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress, faxed on the 29 November 2003; the Tribunal made findings which were not open on the evidence; and that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant could avoid harm if he ceased to be involved in politics in India. 15 The appellant provided five pages of written submissions in support of the purported grounds of appeal. The Minister responded in detail to those submissions. When the appeal was called on for hearing, the appellant informed the Court to the effect that he had nothing to add beyond the scope and text of his written submissions. 16 The submissions of the appellant purportedly addressed the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and did not at least explicitly purport to address the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court. This reflects an unfortunate trend in the submissions of unrepresented appellants in migration cases. I will address below those written submissions of the appellant in any event, and by reference to the issue headings as formulated by the Minister. 17 On any fair and reasonable analysis of the reasons for judgment of Barnes FM, her Honour did not fail to take into account relevant considerations or evidence relating to the contention raised by the appellant that he would experience harm whenever he might be returned to India. The appellant was in that regard a member of the TMC, which on the evidence before the Tribunal is a political party that exists in West Bengal, and not the remainder of India. In any event, at the Tribunal hearing the appellant asserted that the reason why relocation was not possible was because of his upper middle class origins, language and ethnicity, which generalities of description were inferentially or inherently addressed in the Tribunal's reasons. In those circumstances, the purported case that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration was not made out. 18 In the appellant's written submissions, he also contended that the Tribunal failed to consider whether relocation was reasonable, since the police could still find him anywhere in India in relation to the alleged false charges. However that submission failed to recognise that the Tribunal rejected that claim for reasons which included the circumstance that the appellant had been able to live unhindered with relatives in Mumbai and that his departure to Australia was unhurried despite the receipt of a visitor's visa. 19 The appellant also asserted that the Tribunal failed to consider that the sporadic political violence it was said to have acknowledged as having occurred was a 'threat to life or liberty [or] significant harassment'; however the Tribunal did consider whether the violence, which it accepted occurred, would constitute serious harm within the meaning of s 91R(1)(b) of the Act and rejected the suggestion that it would do so. 21 The appellant also complained that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the Tribunal's concerns about the Dum Dum Trinamool Yuba Congress letter which he tendered; however, as Barnes FM observed, s 422B of the Act , SZBDF , and SZEGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1514 at [29] (Edmonds J) constituted an answer to that suggestion.

I find that the Tribunal's finding that the appellant's ' activities demonstrate that he would not be perceived by his adversaries as having political influence or profile ' was open on the evidence. 27 Contrary to the assertion advanced by the appellant in ground 9 of the notice of appeal, the Tribunal did not find that the appellant could evade harm by not being politically active. Rather, as already outlined, the Tribunal found that he had not previously been subjected to persecution and did not have a profile likely to attract persecution in the future.

Case1504,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326,"On 30 March 2006, I found that the respondent ('Siminton') had committed contempt by breaching and failing to comply with certain orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006 ('the Sundberg J orders): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326 ('the first judgment'). These reasons for judgment use the terms employed in, and are to be read together with, the first judgment. 2 The contempts committed by Siminton fall into two categories. The first category consisted of Siminton dealing with, and giving instructions in relation to, the disposition of moneys in certain bank accounts in the manner set out in charges 1.1 and 1.2 of the first statement of charge and in charges 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 of the second statement of charge ('the disposal contempts'): see [16]-[30] of the first judgment. The second category, which consisted of a failure by Siminton to post notices on two websites, was the subject of charge 1.5 of the first statement of charge ('the website contempts'): see [38]-[41] of the first judgment. 3 APRA submitted that the disposal contempts amounted to criminal contempt. In particular, APRA submitted that the disposal contempts were 'a calculated and clandestine attempt to withdraw funds from the Terra Nova Cache account, in deliberate defiance of paragraph 2(b) [of the Sundberg J orders], indicating [Siminton's] attitude to the Court's authority.' APRA pointed to, inter alia , the following factors to support its contention: 'The [disposal] contempts involve breaches...on 5 separate occasions... The Respondent deliberately disobeyed the orders. Large sums of money are involved in the breaches of paragraph 2(b) electronic transfers of $622,880 ... and an attempted cash withdrawal of $500 000. The contempts...were calculated and disguised. The contempts were committed in the context of proceedings against the Respondent alleging contraventions of the Banking Act where public funds may have become imperilled. There are no mitigating factors, such as contrition (the Respondent has not put on any affidavit material in support of his defence).' 4 I am satisfied that APRA's submissions as to the nature of Siminton's contempts are supported by the evidence and are plainly correct. On the evidence before the Court, it is clear that Siminton's disposal contempts were of an extremely serious kind and constituted wilful disobedience and contumacious disregard of the Court's orders. The seriousness of the breaches is underlined by the fact that Siminton's conduct was precisely the kind of conduct against which Sundberg J sought to guard by the making of the orders the subject of the contempt charges. The conduct involved the actual transfer of large sums of money ($536 880.18, $38 000, $43 000, $5 000 and $10 000 respectively) and an attempted cash withdrawal from a Bendigo Bank account of $500 000, all of which occurred shortly after Siminton became aware of the Sundberg J orders. I would add that the failure of Siminton to obtain the cash withdrawal of $500 000 from the Bendigo Bank account came about fortuitously and not as a result of any change of mind on the part of Siminton. I am prepared to infer that the nature and sequence of the transfers effected by Siminton, and his attempt to withdraw a significant amount of cash from an account with which he had no previous association, were an attempt by Siminton to avoid detection by APRA. I can more readily draw that inference in the absence of any explanation of the transactions in question by Siminton. The seriousness of the disposal contempts is exacerbated by the fact that, as a result of the transfers made in breach of the orders, amounts of $5 000, $10 000 and $43 880.18 (ie $617 880.18 transferred to Agios account via Technocash less $574 000 transferred from that account to the Bendigo Bank account) appear to have been taken outside the direct protection of the Sundberg J orders. That observation is made on the assumption that the $574 000 transferred to the Bendigo Bank account (of which Siminton attempted to withdraw $500 000) is still within the direct protection of the Sundberg J orders. 5 Because of the belated compliance by Siminton with the Sundberg J orders in relation to posting notices on the two websites, the website contempts are less serious. Although the website contempts evidence a disregard by Siminton for the orders of the Court, they would not, standing alone, warrant a term of imprisonment. 6 The findings set out above are based on the evidence adduced at the hearing on liability and on APRA's written submissions on liability and penalty filed prior to the penalty hearing. Siminton's response to APRA's evidence and submissions was to continue to maintain, as he is entitled to do, that he 'is constrained from personally giving evidence in support of his plea by his exercise of the right against self-incrimination'. Another response was to file some material to the effect that his solicitor was making an endeavour to settle the main proceeding. Siminton also filed a statement by a friend stating that he was of good character. His counsel supplemented that statement from the bar table. The responses set out above are relevant to penalty but, having regard to the seriousness of the contempt, carry little weight on the issue of penalty. 7 Siminton's counsel also relied on the fact that Siminton had no prior contempt convictions and had eventually posted at least one of the requisite notices. I accept that both of those matters should be taken into account in Siminton's favour on the issue of penalty. 10 As I explained at [10]-[11] of the first judgment, the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has lost much of its significance. In so far as the distinction might be relevant to penalty, I am satisfied that the disposal contempts involved deliberate defiance of the Sundberg J orders and constituted a criminal contempt. As stated above, because the disposal contempts were disguised steps calculated to defeat, and which in part defeated, the purpose of the Sundberg J orders, they amount to particularly serious contempts. 11 Although Siminton has not gone into evidence about his contempts, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt in relation to the website contempts, in that I am prepared to regard them as not involving deliberate defiance. Accordingly, in so far as it may be relevant to penalty, I treat those contemps as civil contempts. 12 Siminton has provided no evidence about his financial circumstances. However, APRA has adduced some evidence relevant to that matter. He was made bankrupt on 9 August 2001 and has failed to provide a statement of affairs or to deliver up his passport as required by the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the BA '). As a discharge usually only occurs three years after the filing of a statement of affairs, the bankruptcy is likely to continue for at least three more years. Under s 58 of the BA , the property of Siminton, including 'after-acquired property' as defined in s 58(6) , vested in his trustee on his bankruptcy. A fine imposed on a bankrupt is not provable in bankruptcy (see s 82(3) of the BA ). There is no evidence that Siminton has any capacity to pay a fine and the interlocutory orders made in the proceeding prevent him from accessing any of the funds upon which he might otherwise lawfully draw upon to pay any fine. 16 I accept that imprisonment should be a last resort but, having regard to the circumstances outlined above, I am in no doubt that in relation to the disposal contempts a term of imprisonment is both appropriate and necessary to vindicate the Court's authority. I regard personal deterrence as remaining a significant factor but I regard general deterrence as being of particular importance in the present case. Freezing orders of the kind made by Sundberg J are commonly made by the courts in order to preserve the status quo pending an interlocutory or final hearing. If such orders were seen as being able to be disobeyed with impunity that would significantly undermine the ability of the courts to effectively administer justice according to law.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.076,0.111,0.814,-0.994,-0.4410000000000003

However, other criminal history is irrelevant: R v Giscombe (1984) 79 Cr App R 79 at 84. 1.6 In deciding the amount of any fine the Court should take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v R (1991) 25 NSWLR 1. The court may also suspend the fine on terms. Contrition and apology 1.7 Genuine contrition and a full and ample apology may also reduce the penalty: R v Gray [1900] 2 QB 36 at 41-2; Superstar Australia Pty Ltd v Coonan &amp; Denlay Pty Ltd (No 2) (1982) 65 FLR 432 at 436. Imprisonment 1.8 It is widely accepted that the court should only impose a term of imprisonment in the most serious criminal contempt cases: Keeley v Justice Brooking [1979] HCA 28 ; (1979) 143 CLR 162 at 179; Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. 1.9 In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Hickey [1999] FCA 259 , Carr J held that imprisonment is a ""last resort"": see also R v Vasin (1985) 39 SASR 45; James (1985) 14 A Crim R 364; Skipper (1992) 64 A Crim R 260.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.061,0.124,0.815,-0.9827,-0.3764500000000002

I observed in Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 629 at [79] that the rule of law in a democratic society does not permit any member of the society to pick and choose the laws or court orders that are to be observed and those that are not. I added: 'Maintenance of the rule of law in our society does not only require that parties are able to resort to courts to determine their disputes ( Patrick Stevedores Operation No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 31 ; (1998) 153 ALR 641 at [1] per Hayne J), it also requires that parties comply with the orders made by the courts in determining those disputes.'",Criminal Case,Murder,0.054,0.068,0.878,-0.0516,2.8333999999999997
Case1507,"Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19 ; (1998) 198 CLR 435","In Pelechowski v The Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19 ; (1998) 198 CLR 435 at 463 [88] McHugh J observed: 'if breaches of court orders were regarded as of little moment, respect for and observance of the law would inevitably deteriorate and, ultimately, pose a threat to social order.' 19 In my view, the object of general deterrence in the present case requires that a penalty be imposed that protects the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the Court's orders cannot be disobeyed with impunity. 20 APRA submits that for each of the disposal contempts the appropriate penalty is a sentence of imprisonment of nine months and that for each of the website contempts the appropriate penalty is a sentence of one month, with the sentences to be served concurrently. 21 The Court has a broad discretion as to penalty. Having regard to the factors set out above and the matters put forward by counsel on behalf of Siminton, the appropriate term of imprisonment for the disposal contempts is 10 weeks. I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions, the penalty would have been significantly greater. I am also not prepared to accede to Siminton's submission that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended. In the present case, there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to justify suspending the sentence. 22 As explained above, the website contempts did not involve deliberate defiance and therefore do not warrant imprisonment. Although I have expressed doubt as to the efficacy of a fine in respect of Siminton, I have decided that a fine of $5 000 is appropriate in respect of the website contempts. In arriving at that figure, I have given particular weight to the absence of any satisfactory explanation, regret, contrition or remorse on Siminton's part. 23 APRA sought to have Siminton pay its costs in respect of the contempt motions on a 'party-party' basis. I am satisfied that APRA is entitled to have its costs paid on that basis. Although APRA failed on its 'failure to file allegations', those allegations played a very small part in the contempt case. In the circumstances, I am prepared to order that Siminton pay APRA's costs of and incidental to the contempt proceedings on a party-party basis.

Case1509,Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52,"Mr Oke submits that the execution of the Birchgrove warrant was illegal and that the AFP should be ordered to return, or destroy, the hard drive image. His application raises various issues regarding the provisions of Part IAA of the Act, and the interaction of those provisions with the common law of legal professional privilege, including the principle enunciated by the High Court in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52, that a document recording a privileged communication cannot be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 (now s 3E) of the Act. 6 The validity of the Birchgrove warrant itself is not challenged. What is challenged is the validity of its execution. There are three issues to be determined on the application concerning the validity of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant: 1. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because it did not comply with s 3H of the Act, in that the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not contain the name of the issuing officer and the handwritten portion of the attestation clause; 2. Whether the execution of the search was invalid because the copy of the warrant provided to Mr Oke at the commencement of the search did not have attached a copy of the privilege notice; 3. Whether the seizure of the laptop computer was invalid because the executing officer did not have the requisite state of mind specified in s 3F of the Act or because it was the subject of a claim of legal professional privilege; Submissions were also directed to the appropriate forms of relief if any of those claims were made out. 7 A further issue arose on the amended application, but no longer arises. It concerned the purported return of the laptop computer, and then its re-seizure from Mr Oke, on 2 July 2004, apparently invoking s 3K of the Act. Senior counsel for the AFP during the hearing of the application acknowledged that the AFP's entitlement to retain the laptop computer or a copy of its hard drive was not enhanced by what occurred on 2 July 2004 or by s 3K of the Act. It is not therefore necessary to further address that issue. 101 In Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52 , the High Court by majority concluded that, in the event that legal professional privilege attaches to and is maintained in respect of documents held by a legal firm, those documents cannot properly be made the subject of a search warrant issued under s 10 of the Act. Section 10 of the Act has since been repealed but it is similar, for present purposes, to the relevant parts of ss 3E and 3F. In Baker v Campbell it was assumed that the documents in issue were privileged, as the matter was heard on a case stated. 102 The practical difficulties which may arise in circumstances where legal professional privilege is claimed in respect of documents which would otherwise fall within the terms of a search warrant were recognised by Wilson J, who said (at 97): ""It is asserted that a claim of privilege in circumstances where the proceedings in respect of which it is made have not begun immediately raises procedural difficulties if the claim is contested. There is no judge already seized of jurisdiction in the matter to determine the disputed claim. The interests of all parties must be protected pending a determination of the dispute. In my experience the procedural difficulties can be overcome consistently with that objective if the members respectively of the police force and the legal profession co-operate in a reasonable and responsible way. I do not think that it is necessary for the purposes of the stated case to explore the problem."" 103 Following the decision in Baker v Campbell, the Law Council of Australia and the AFP entered into an agreement as to the manner in which such claims should be treated. The terms of that agreement form the guidelines contained in the privilege notice and which were attached to the original Birchgrove warrant. 104 The privilege notice reads as follows: ""If a claim is made for legal professional privilege in respect of any document covered by the warrant, and if the person claiming privilege is prepared to co-operate with the executing officer, the following procedure will be followed to the extent to which it is possible to do so: 1. The executing officer or a constable assisting will prepare a list of the relevant documents in cooperation with the person claiming privilege. The list will show the general nature of each document, the ground on which privilege is claimed, and the name of the person claiming privilege; 2. The documents will be placed in an envelope or other container which will be sealed; 3. The list and the container will be endorsed with a note to the effect that, having regard to the claim for privilege, the warrant has not been executed in respect of the documents set out in the list and that those documents have been sealed in the container pending resolution of the claim; 4. The list and the container will be signed by the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 5. The sealed container and a copy of the list will be delivered to a third party agreed between the executing officer or constable assisting and the person claiming privilege; 6. The third party shall hold the container and the copy of the list pending resolution of the claim for privilege; 7. Subject to any agreement to the contrary, the person claiming privilege will have four working days after delivery to the third party in which to commence proceedings to establish the privilege claimed. If proceedings are commenced within that time the sealed container and the copy of the list will be delivered to the registrar of the court in which the proceedings have been brought. The documents will then be held by the registrar pending the order of the court; 8. Subject to paragraph 9, if proceedings are not commenced within four working days, or such other period as may be agreed, the third party will deliver the documents, or such of them as the executing officer still wishes to examine, to the executing officer; 9. Nothing in this document prevents the executing officer from discussing a claim for privilege with the person raising the claim. If agreement can be reached on which documents are covered by legal professional privilege, and which are not, the third party will be asked to act in accordance with that agreement. If the person claiming legal professional privilege is not prepared to cooperate with the executing officer, it will normally be necessary for the executing officer or a constable assisting to examine each relevant document to determine whether there is a proper basis for seizure."" 105 Mr Oke contended that, as a matter of law, it is not possible to ""seize"" an item under the Act which is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege. 106 The respondent submitted that the effect of the decision in Baker v Campbell is only that a search warrant cannot be executed in a manner which abrogates or nullifies the claim of privilege. It was said that to ""seize"" a document or thing means to take it into lawful possession subject to the claim of privilege being determined, so that seizure under the Act was still possible even if the seized item may ultimately be recognised as privileged. 107 I do not accept either contention. In my view, Baker v Campbell decides that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of privileged documents. The Birchgrove warrant must therefore be read as authorising seizure of the documents that satisfy the conditions specified, provided that they are not documents subject to legal professional privilege. Nor does it decide that a search warrant cannot authorise the seizure of documents in respect of which there is merely a claim to legal professional privilege. That question did not arise. Nor, upon my reading of the judgments in Baker v Campbell , is there anything said in that case to support such a contention. 112 I consider their Honours' conclusion is consistent with the decision in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; 153 CLR 52. In Baker v Campbell the documents the subject of the search warrant were assumed to be privileged from disclosure or production on the ground of legal professional privilege. In that event, they could not be the subject of a search warrant under the Act. So, here, if the laptop computer and all its contents were to be so protected, it could not have been the subject of the Birchgrove warrant and its seizure would not have been authorised. The approach of the Full Court in JMA Accounting addresses the circumstances where there is a contested claim to such privilege and the practicality that it cannot be immediately resolved (and where s 3K(2) has not been availed of).",Criminal Case,Murder,0.149,0.025,0.827,0.9996,6.3776
Case1510,Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437,"Spender J considered the validity of a series of s 3E search warrants which failed to name the issuing officer in Seeter Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (2004) 210 ALR 437. In that case, the attack was upon the validity of the warrants, rather than upon the validity of their execution. His Honour concluded at 453-454, [60]-[63] that the omission of the issuing officer's name did not invalidate the warrants. He noted at 453, [60] that each page of the search warrants under consideration bore the registration number and signature of the issuing officer, and the official stamp of the issuing authority. In those circumstances, Spender J was satisfied that the issuing officer had ""adequately identified her capacity to issue the warrants"": at 454, [63]. Although I was referred to that case by counsel, on reflection I do not think it assists in resolving the present issue. The Birchgrove warrant itself is not under attack, and it contains the name of the issuing officer as well as a completed attestation clause. 44 Part IAA of the Act was introduced by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). It clearly prescribes specific powers and safeguards in relation to warrants and other matters in the investigation of Commonwealth offences, including safeguards of the rights of individuals in relation to whom the coercive investigatory powers of the Commonwealth are invoked. Of particular significance to the present issue is that the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994 (Cth) stated, in relation to s 3H(5): ""In order to prevent forgery or other wrongful use of the warrant copy, subsection 3H(5) provides that the copy need not include the signature of the issuing officer or the seal of the Court. This provision has been included at the specific request of the ACT Chief Magistrate."" 45 There is no prescribed form for a search warrant issued under s 3E. Subsections 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify information which an issuing officer must state in a search warrant issued under that section. That information includes the time at which the search warrant expires: s 3E(5)(e). Section 3E(5A) directs that the time so specified must be not later than the end of the seventh day after the day on which the search warrant is issued. Those subsections do not expressly require the issuing officer to be described in, or to sign, the search warrant. 46 However, in my view, it is implicit that a search warrant will also bear on its face sufficient information to identify that it has in fact been issued by an issuing officer, so that any person entitled to see a copy of the search warrant under s 3H(1) can be satisfied as to its authenticity. That was the point made by Spender J in Seeter 210 ALR at 254, [63]. Section 3H(5) also supports the inference that a search warrant issued under s 3E should bear the signature of the issuing officer or some means of identifying that the issuing officer is in fact a person falling within the definition of ""issuing officer"" in s 3C(1) of the Act. That is because it expressly permits the copy of a search warrant made available under s 3H(1) not to include the signature of the issuing officer. The use of the seal of a court as part of that identification would not necessarily be expected, as the issue of a search warrant under the Act is an administrative or executive act rather than a judicial one. 47 On the Birchgrove warrant, the attestation clause was immediately preceded by words addressing the requirement of s 3E(5)(e) in the following terms: ""THIS WARRANT MAY BE EXECUTED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 6.00 AM AND 8.00 PM. THE TIME AT WHICH THIS WARRANT EXPIRES IS MIDNIGHT AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER THE DAY ON WHICH THE WARRANT IS ISSUED"" In its unexecuted form, it then continued: ""GIVEN under my hand at ......... in the State of ..................... this ......... day of ..................... .......................................... A Magistrate in and for the State of ........................"" 48 The way in which the original Birchgrove warrant was completed by the issuing officer is described in [19] above. 74 The purpose of s 3H(1) has not been the subject of much judicial discussion. Nor was its purpose explored in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law: Fourth Interim Report , Canberra, November 1990 (the Gibbs Committee Report) which presaged the introduction of Part 1AA into the Act by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994 (Cth). (The history of Part 1AA is discussed by the Full Court in Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner, Australia Federal Police (1997) 75 FCR 145 at 147-148.) In Wright v Queensland Police Service [2002] 2 Qd R 667, Holmes J at [30] referred to the ability of an occupier to whom a copy of a search warrant is made available being able ""to ascertain the scope of the authority conferred by [the warrant] or the jurisdiction by which it was issued"".

Case1511,"Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51","It is unclear whether the failure to attach the privilege notice constituted a breach of the Act. There is no requirement under the Act that a s 3E warrant contain a notice regarding an occupier's right to claim privilege over documents the subject of the warrant. In Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 86 FCR 51, French J held that a search warrant issued pursuant to the Act was not invalid for failing to expressly limit its scope to documents the subject of legal professional privilege. The applicant nevertheless maintains that if the AFP chooses to include the privilege notice in the original warrant it must, pursuant to s 3H(1), be included in the occupier's copy.",Criminal Case,Rape,0.124,0.076,0.799,0.6599,5.258649999999999
Case1512,Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69,"I am not persuaded, in the circumstances, that the privilege notice was not ""made available"" to Mr Oke as part of the copy of the warrant. Section 5H(1) does not prescribe how or when the copy of a search warrant is to be made available. Whether it has been made available is a question of fact. Ideally, the copy should be made available at one time, and as early as possible. But having regard to the purpose of s 5H(1), if there were some delay in the commencement or progress of the search authorised by a search warrant, the copy might be made available at a later point in time if the purpose were not thereby frustrated. And, one can readily imagine, a page or pages of a copy might accidentally become removed from the copy prepared for presentation. In such a case, assuming the page or pages were otherwise significant (in the way identified above), the delay in providing them might not mean that they were not provided as part of the copy made available. If, upon inspecting the copy made available, the occupier noticed and drew attention to the fact that pages were missing, and they were then provided, I think s 5H(1) would have been satisfied. There are obviously many other possible circumstances. Having regard to the observations of Kirby J in Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49 ; (1997) 192 CLR 69 ( Ousley ) at 144, whether there has been compliance is a matter of fact and degree. On the evidence in this matter, I find that the privilege notice was provided to Mr Rydon at a sufficiently early point in the process of the execution of the Birchgrove warrant that its earlier absence had not affected adversely any claim for legal professional privilege Mr Oke made or the way in which his claim for legal professional privilege was treated. I therefore find that the provision of the privilege notice in the circumstances completed (in that respect) the making available of the Birchgrove warrant. 72 Moreover, subs 3E(5), (6) and (7) specify what the legislature considers must appear in a warrant. Those provisions appear to exhaustively state the matters the warrant must disclose to make it valid (see e.g. Ousley 192 CLR at 111). In general terms, they also define the extent of the authority conferred (see e.g. per Gaudron J in Ousley 192 CLR at 94), although s 3F then enlarges upon the extent of that authority. 73 Section 3E does not expressly require the name of the issuing officer to be included in the warrant. However, s 3H(5) indicates that the issuing officer will have signed the search warrant and by implication that the name of the issuing officer will appear on it. 80 In reaching that view, I am mindful that if the Birchgrove premises were unattended, the execution of the Birchgrove warrant may have proceeded lawfully even though the copy intended to be provided was incomplete. I do not think that consideration affects my conclusion. Kirby J in Ousley 192 CLR at 144 observed that ""Courts properly tend to take a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those subject to them"". The fact that, in different circumstances, the Birchgrove warrant might have been lawfully executed, or indeed the fact that the Birchgrove warrant itself was available to be provided to Mr Oke (but was not made available to him), does not diminish the significance of the non-compliance with s 5H(1) in the particular circumstances. 81 I am mindful that Federal Agent Capaldo had in her possession the Birchgrove warrant and could have made it available to Mr Oke. She did not however do so, but only provided a copy of the Birchgrove warrant in the form referred to above. 82 The omission of the privilege notice (assuming contrary to my view that, in this respect also, s 5H(1) was not complied with), does not have the same consequence. Its absence does not affect the capacity of Mr Oke to be satisfied of the nature of the authority being exercised or its extent. The copy of the Birchgrove warrant initially made available included the note quoted in [20] above. The fact that Mr Oke may have claimed legal professional privilege was therefore identified.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.091,0.021,0.888,0.9927,6.404450000000001
Case1513,Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576,"It was submitted alternatively on behalf of Mr Oke that the later provision of the privilege notice meant that the Birchgrove warrant was not executed reasonably, and so was invalid, relying on Arno v Forsyth (1986) 9 FCR 576. The same findings lead me to conclude that there was not such unreasonableness in the execution of the Birchgrove warrant as to lead to its invalidity. 63 The failure to provide a complete copy of the original Birchgrove warrant (subject to s 3H(5)) amounted to a breach s 3H(1). There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the AFP can selectively determine which parts of a search warrant it will make available to the occupier, and which parts it will not. However, it does not necessarily follow that the effect of that breach is to invalidate the entire search.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.033,0.023,0.944,0.128,3.4379999999999997
Case1514,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"The majority of the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) said at 388-9, [91]: ""An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition.""",Criminal Case,Rape,0.042,0.041,0.917,-0.2263,2.2069500000000004
Case1515,Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384,"The construction of the Act, and particularly of s 3H, was considered (in a different context) by the Full Court of this Court in Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 ; (2002) 124 FCR 384. Relevantly, the Court said: ""[64] The construction of statutes authorising the search of premises and the seizure of things from them begins with the ordinary meaning of the words considered according to their context and the legislative purpose... [65] The purpose of search and seizure provisions is to provide for the gathering of information to determine whether offences have been committed and to facilitate proof of them: Rogers v Moore (1992) 39 FCR 201 at 217 per French J. Recognition of that purpose may yield a construction of the legislative words that is not necessarily narrowly defined. Remaining ambiguity or doubt whether of meaning or application will, in accordance with authority, be resolved in favour of the rights and freedoms of the subject... [68]...[E]ffect must be given to the importance attached by the legislature to the use of search warrants as an important and legitimate tool in the detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Where the language of the statute authorising their use offers choices between one construction requiring fine legal judgments in the issue and/or execution of warrants and another which is more likely to be consistent with operational realities then the latter construction is generally to be preferred ...""",Criminal Case,Murder,0.069,0.054,0.877,-0.0258,2.8947000000000003
Case1516,Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37,"In their analysis of the competing policy considerations underpinning the Act, their Honours relied upon the following passage from the judgment of Lord Cooper in Lawrie v Muir [1950] SLT 37 (at 39-40): ""From the standpoint of principle it seems to me that the law must strive to reconcile two highly important interests which are liable to come into conflict (a) the interest of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasions of his liberties by the authorities, and (b) the interests of the State to secure that evidence bearing upon the commission of crime and necessary to enable justice to be done shall not be withheld from Courts of law on any merely formal or technical ground. Neither of these objects can be insisted upon to the uttermost. The protection of the citizen is primarily protection for the innocent citizen against unwarranted, wrongful and perhaps high-handed interference, and the common sanction is an action of damages. The protection is not intended as a protection for the guilty citizen against the efforts of the public prosecutor to vindicate the law. On the other hand the interest of the State cannot be magnified to the point of causing all the safeguards for the protection of the citizen to vanish, and of offering a positive inducement to the authorities to proceed by irregular methods."" 67 The invasion of premises without the consent of the occupier is authorised by a warrant issued under s 3E of the Act. The validity of such a warrant necessarily depends upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. The legislative imposition of those conditions reflects the balance struck between the desirability of an effective and efficient investigation of suspected criminal offences and the need to protect the right of an individual to enjoy that person's privacy and property.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.148,0.075,0.778,0.9742,6.3397
Case1517,George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104,"The High Court in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 said at 111: ""... the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation."" (my emphasis) It must be recognised that that case concerned the validity of the issue of a search warrant, and not the validity of the execution of a validly issued search warrant, although the underlying principles referred to by the High Court would appear to me to apply equally in the case of the execution of a warrant. 69 The consequence of the failure to comply with such statutory conditions may lead to the invalidity of the search warrant itself. George v Rockett is an example. Counsel for Mr Oke also relied upon certain observations in Woodroffe v National Crime Authority [1999] FCA 591 at [14] - [15] , but I do not consider that case advances Mr Oke's position simply because it concerned an application by the National Crime Authority to summarily dismiss a challenge to the validity of a search warrant and to the manner of its execution. Consequently, the Court was called upon only to determine whether the grounds of the challenge were arguable. The copy of the search warrant made available to the person challenging the validity of the execution of the search warrant was assumed not to have included the privilege notice.",Criminal Case,Murder,0.053,0.04,0.907,-0.2617,2.07105
